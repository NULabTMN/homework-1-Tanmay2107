When a ball goes out of bounds it is put in
play in the same way as in a foot ball game.
The game consists of two halft of twenty
minutes each or such time as the captains may
decide on. and time is taken out for delays.
A goal counts three points and a foul one
point for the opponent. and a majority of the
points decides the game.
There are a referee and umpire, whose duties
are the same respectively as the same officials
in a foot ball game.
Any player has a right to get the ball at any
time while it is in the field of play. provided
that he handles only the ball and not the op
ponent.
ADVANTAGEs OF THE GAME.
To an observer the game seemed to be one
that will solve the problem, which has been a
knotty one for some time, of introdncing a
game which will meet the excitement incident
to most outdoor sports and at the same time
be suitable for indoor play. At present when
the outdoor season closes most of the athletes
drop tbe sports in which they have been in
terested and the benefits thev derived from
them are lost. This game is one that requires
skill and agility. but strength is not one of the
necessary factors. and, consequently. men of
all physical conditions can take part in it. It
has also been found to have been a useful
sport for girls and women, as it is especially
APTEn THE FALL.
adapted to securing good health without having
the nervous strain caused by some of the
sports now indulged in.
In its principli. it is a combination of foot
ball and lacrosse. It resembles foot ball in
most of the rulings, but in the method to be
pursued to obtain a goal the game more closely
resembles lacrosse. Although at first glance it
would hardly seem possible to have any amount
of team play in the game, still it is only by the
concerted action that a team can play to the
beet advantage. A novice in the game inva
riably feels disposed when he obtains the ball
to make a shot for the goal, which could not be
made from any distance one time in a hundred,
as in order that the ball should remain in the
basket it has to be skillfully and easily tossed,
not thrown. A good player will. when he has
the ball, quickly look for one of his own team
who is in an uncovered position to whom he
can tos it. In this way a well-drilled team
could almost entirely keep the ball from the
hands of a team made up of new men. Quick
ness of eye, hand and foot is one of the first
requisites for a good player, and he also must
keep his head about him. A moment's hesita
tion or a wrong pass may give considerable
advantage to the other side.
If an umpire is chosen who strictly follows
the rules of the game there is little chance for
any roughness, as running with the ball is
prohibited, and thus the injuries coming from
sharp tackling in foot bal are done away with.
The attention of the player is fastened on the
ball and personal feeling in the matter is lost
sight of. The object of each player when one
of his side obtains the ball is to place himself
in an uncovered position so that one of his own
team can pays it to him, while the opponents
should in this eae stick closely to the men
with whom they are paired so that a pass to
them would gave an equal opportunity for each
to catch the ball. It is in this respect that
cool-beadedt.euand quickness count. Idi
vidlual play on the part of one man will destroy
all the good work that the rest of the team may
do. If the game in played indoors in a gym
naisium the passee should be more of a toes
rather than hard straight throw.
As the game has apparently obtained a good
foothold in this city and as it is a healthful and
at the same times exciting sport it is to be
hoped that the efforts of Mr. Joyce to make the
game a popular one in this city will meet with
success, Some of the men under him are bo
conming quite proficient and before long he will
have a iirst-class team,</text>

	<text>THE GAME OF BASKET BALL.
Interesting and Exciting Sport For Thos
Not Able to Exercise Kegularly.
The unnounceinent that at a woman's
educational institution not far from this
city tho students played a close and ex
citing game of "basket ball" wasperhaia
the first item which attracted public at
tention to a sport that is rapidly becom
ing very popular in this country among
those who have neither the physique nor
the taste for baseball or football. The
rules of the new sport are comparatively
simple, and the ease with which the
fundamental laws of the game can be
acquired in a few minutes' practice have
served to make it popular wherever it
has been introduced, while its freedom
from much of the roughness and intri
cacy of football has also tended to make
the devotees of basket ball enthusiastic
in their praise of its merits.
The name "basket ball" is derived from
the fact that scores are made not by car
rying the ball across the goal lines or
kicking it over the goal bar as in foot
ball, but by throwing the spheroid into I
a moderately small basket, which is hung
about 10 feet above the ground or floor.
To accomplish Buch a feat usually re
quires much practice, and as a rule tho
try at goals are far more numerous than
tho scores. Either hand or both hands
can be used in holding the ball, and it
must either he thrown or be batted with
tho open hand a punch with the fist or
arm, or a kick, constituting a foul.
The game differs from football also in
tho fact that no player is allowed to run
with the ball, but must stand where it is
caught, and a fair catch can be made
only with the hands. If the ball is held
for an unnecessarily long time, the um
pire takes possession of it and puts it
"ia play" by throwing it in the air, no
player being allowed to touch it in such
an event until it has struck the ground.
If a ball goes out of bounds, it is put in
play as in football, and no player is "off
sido," but every player has the right to
touch the ball anywhere or everywhere
in the game, provided the ball is in play.
No pushing, tripping, 6hoving or tac
kling is allowed, and every such offense
constitutes a foul, which gives one point
to the opposing nine. As a goal counts
but threo points and a foul one. there is
every incentive to avoid rough play. The
players advance the ball by tossing it to
some member of their own nine, and
there is the best opportunity for success
in personal skill combined with good
team play. The "forwards" and "cen
ters" usually toss the ball forward, but
when it gets dangerously near his own
goal, the goalkeeper often bats it with
tho open palm.
Ono advantago which basket ball has
over many other forms of popular sport
lies in tho fact that, while it allows 18
players to participate, it can be pursued
tho year round in tho open air during
tho warmer months and in the gymna
sium whilo cold weather prevails. Again,
basket ball can be played by persons
whose physique is not of tho most robust
type, although many athletes also have
found, in it a healthful form of exercise.
It has pypved of great value In furnish
ing exercise for business men, women
and children, as wpll as brawny students,
and from the general success it has al
ready attained wherever it has been in
troduced there is every probability that
basket ball will soon become a very popu
lar and widespread form of outdoor and
indoor sport. Boston Advertiser.</text>

	<text>BASKET BALL.
Those who were interested in the
basket ball games played last winter
will be pleased to learn that the town
and school boys are tohaveonemore
battle for the supremacy. A word
about the game which has become so
popular in the past few years will
be interesting to those who enjoy
good honest sport.
Basket ball was invented in 1889 by
ames Nuismith, teacher in the interna
tional training school, Springfield. Dur
ing its first season it wasnot particularly
popular hut has gained in favor and may
now be called quite as important sport in
the Y. M. C. A. world as football and
baseball, but it is essentially an indoor
game and the interest that is excited in
an exercise confined to the gymnasium
can perhaps never equal the zest which is
thrown into a game like football, played
under the blue of heaven, in the fresh out
door atmosphere and sun's rays that seem
to penetrate the muscles ot the athlete
and impart added vivacity. However,
at the season when football bruises have
long ago healed and conquests on the
gridiron are matters for rumination, he
who sighs for the pigskin can find much
satisfaction in basket ball, it possessing
all the elements of football but, if rules
are enforced, lacking the excessive rough
ness. The ball used is perlcctly round,
made of a rubber bladder, covered with
leather and is about a foot in diameter.
Briefly outlined the game according to
official rules for 1805, is played as follows:
baskets especially constructed tor the
purpose, are placed in a vertical position
with the mouth ten feetlrom the ground,
one at each end of the field (gymnasium),
occupying much the same position in re
lation to the players as do football goals.
i ne competitive teams tane positions on
the field as in football, save that there is
no line-up, The teams are composed of
five men when the playing space is less
than 1800 square feet, seven when it is
more than 1800 and less than 3600 and
nine men when over 3600. The referee,
with a player from each side, takes posi
tion in the center. He puts the ball in
play by throwing it up. Which side has
first ball depends on which center man
secures it. The ball is not kicked or
struck with the fists but thrown or batted
with the flat of the hand and the object
is, to get it into the basket, doing which
scores a goal. On the number of goals
secured depends the victory. The net
work of rules which govern the action of
the game is quite as elaborate as football
and will not be given here. Suffice it to
say that spectators easily comprehend
its action. The putting of a ball into the
basket may seem a veryeasv thing to do
but as a matter of fact it is very difficult
to acomplish with the floor empty and,
of course, much more so when two teams
are at strife. One of the rules says that
the ball shall always be kept in motion.
Two twenty-minute halves are played
with a rest of ten minutes between "the
halves. This is the time of actual play.
Each side has itscaptain while position
is the same as in baseball. The referee is
judge of the ball. He is the superior offi
cer ot the game and decides all questions
uul ucuimciy lulling on me umpire, i lie
umpire is judge of the men, calls all fouls,
notifies the offenders and has power to
disqualify men.
The game which was to be played
on Thursdayevening of this week has
been postponed until Saturday even
ing. The two teams have been prac
tising faithfully and will be able to
play a very interesting game. It is
hoped that the public will turn out
and encourage the gymnasts, as all
the proceeds over and above the ex
penses are to go towards much need
ed new apparatus for thegymnasium.</text>

BERKELEY, Cal., April I.— The Berke

LAWRENCE. KAS.. Dec. 17.-(SpeciaU
The basket ball "fever" has broken out
In Its most violent form among Kansas
university people. Dr. Naismith. the new
physical director, brought the germs with
him, and that they were healthy specimens
is evidenced by their activity.
At first only a few of the students siw
in basket ball the diversion. But the dis
ease spread rapidly. Not only doe- eai h
class already possess its basket ball team,
but the literary and the scientific men of
the faculty are backing their "crack fives.
Eve-ry evening the gymnasium is filled with
a scrambling mass of humanity, and the
spectators who can recognlz. a friend or
acquaintance In the melee must be gifterd
with second sight.
Five men compose a team at basket ball.
The floor Is divided into three parts. Tho
center men of the plaving teams oe-upy a
space chalked off in the middle, am, the
other four dispose themselves In various
graceful attitudes in the end sections. The
referee tosses up the ball just above the
heads of the centers, who are standing
face to face. Each makes a jump and en
deavors to hit the hall, knocking it over
to his own men and toward his goal. Then,
the scramble begins. The accomplished,
and gentlemanly contortionist in the pat
ent medicine show could not rival basket
ball players In the way of tying French
knots in their corporal systems. The ma.-s
of writhing humanity turns over and over
in kaleidoscopic fashion, suddenly un
winds itself and is again resolved Into
parts. A man goes diving after the ball
and comos triumphantly up out of the
fray with his arms full of another man's
head! The aim In playing basket ball, so
it Is claimed. Is to throw the ball Into tho
round baskets, suspended at each end ot
the field, a greater number of times than
the opposing players. In reality, however,
it would seem that the cherls-hed object of
each plajer was to make as large and
choice collection of hruises as possible.
But that is basket ball from the specta
tor's point of view. To the players It Is
an all absorbing sport. Some of them
even have the audacity to assert that It Isi
a "gentle game, don't you know." Gentle,
indeed! One might as appropriately speak
of a bucking broncho as "well-mannered."
When the field Is not divided into sec
tions the game is reallr rough, but If thi
chalk lines are drawn, and fouls are faith
fully called whenever a man over-teps.
his boundaries, the bruise hunter adds to
Ills collection more slowly. It Is amusing:
to watch the players trying to remember
to have the proper respect for the bound
aries. Indeed It is truly pathetic to sej
what limitations of power a simple chalk
line can put on thee great, strong athletes.
In actual agony they har.g over the edge
and reach out helpless, longing arms to
ward the ball. Now and then an unruly
foot goes across the line, and then the
sharp whistle of the referee Is heard. A
foul entitles the players ort the otht.r side
a chance at throwing goal.
The game consists of two halves of
twenty minutes each. A twenty minute
rest is given between, and a new- team
put on to utilize the rest time. Each time
the ball goes Into the basket two points
are scored for the side whose goal Is
thrown As In baseball, a small score
Indicates a good game.
The Inventor of Ilnsket Hnll.
Dr. James Naismith Is the inventor of
basket ball. Unlike most of our games It
Is not the development of some medieval
sport. It was worked out on scientific
principles to meet a long felt want. Dr.
Naismith was physical director of a Y.
31. C. A. training school at Springfield.
Mass.. where the problem of supplying thlsj
need was brought to him for solution.
Busket ball was the result. It was In the
winter of 9I-52 that the game was intro
duced. The rules were made out and hung
In the "gym" fdr the inspection of playerj
before the game was ever tried. The men
were a little skeptical "at first about it.
but after the; ball was once thrown up no
coaxing was needed to Induce them to
Play. Basket ball came Into general favor
first through the Y. M. C. A. Having been
Introduced through the association it was
natural that it should spread through that
medium. Before long, however, colleges be
gan to investigate and adopt the game, ami
In the short .-pace of seven yeirs It has

colleges, both for men anil for womn.
basket ball Is the reigning favorite among
sports. The rules are not changed for tho
young women players, though doubtless the
game is played with a bit more tenderness.
Though at first sight the game appears
to be a free for all scramble. It soon be
comes evident that a number of sclentiilr?
,1'laya are iossibIe. Unfailing good judg
ment, anu goon muscular control are the
first requisites for a good player. The treat
ment of the ball Is the subject of several
rules. It can be tossed, rolled on Ihe floor
and pushed around, but must never In
kicked. There are no signals, and a play
lasts until the ball Is passed Into the basket.

The Kansas university men are going to
be great basket ball enthusiasts. Each
class has a picked team, and places on thei
teams are as much sought as on the var
sity eleven. Among faculty members thero
are two teams the Snow hall and tho
Frazer hall, representing the scientists and
the literary men. On the former team
Dr. WHHston. Marshall Barber. Clarenco
McClung. A. H. Clark and Dr. Naismith
hold positions. Their opponents are A.
G. Cantield. AY. H. Carruth. E. M. Hop
kins. M. W. Sterling and Archie Hogg.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3 p. m. thesj
distinguished individuals lay aside their
dignity and their collars, don sweaters anil
pugilistic airs, and come forth into the
arena to dw battle. With a grace that
is acciuired only through long years of
bending over desks and laboratory tables,
they scamiier now here, now there, after
the elusive canvas sphere.
When the faculty teams met for their
last practice. Chancellor Snow- appeared.
He was Immediately besieged to play. The
chancellor protested that he was too green,
but such fetching invitations could never
be turned dotvn. The head of the universi
ty disappeared Into a dressing room, and
In a few moments, he emerged In a cos
tume of which the most noticeable feat
ures were- white canvas shoes, a seraphic:
grin, and a neutral tinted sweater. With
characteristic vigor he attacked the game,
and before long he was the champion play
er. There is nothing slow about the chan
cellor when he gets into action.
Tournament in January.
On January 13 an Indoor tournament will
be given. Basket hall will be the chief
feature of the c-xhihltlon. The old skat
ing rink on Kentucky street will probably
be rented for the occasion. Dr. Naismltii
says he enjoys working with college men
far better than with others. He believes
there is no artificiality whatever about e-ol-Iege
students. "If a man is a man they
will respect him and his endeavors in their
behalf." he says, "but they won t Stan. I
trilling a minute. When I find it yo'ing
fellow who kicks on the referee's decision-..
I just ask him n call fouls for a few mo
ments. After he has called a few and other
men have kicked on his rulings, h,. never
kicks again."
Pr. Naismith has much influence t
the young men in his charge. In Mrs. Cora
McColli,m Smith he has an able colleague.
The revolution In feeling which a few yearn
have brought about among the physical
culture students Is remarkable. When the
training was first Introduced about four
years ago and the girls lirst donned their
suits, the presence of a man within a ra
dius of three blocks wrought the most
awful consternation. Now men pass back
and forth throuch the r-vm to and from
the laboratory during the girls" cla.-aes and
ni'liing is thought ot it. Before long :hi

frage in ainietirs is one oi me cnarms of

must get a basket ball guide beforehand and

the day. It may not be a great while. Judg-

	<text>NEW RULES ON BASKETBALL
Changed Conditions For Championship
Contests.
Up to the present the basketball
rules have been amended each season
by additions and omissions in various
places. This year, however, the rules
have been rearranged and many rules
bear different numbers and are not
found in the same successive order.
An advantage in the new rule book
also is that at the top of the page i3
the page, so that it is no longer neccs-
indicated the rule number printed on
that page, so that it is no longer ne
cessary to turn back or forth to ascer
tain which rule is being read.
The first new feature is that the
rules became effective Nov. 1, 1904.
This settled a fixed time for everywhere
and did not leave it open for teams to
play old Ule3 because "they did not
have the new book and there is noth
ing in the rules saying when they be
come effective," In referring to the
basket, the word "basket" is not used
in contradiction to "goal."
The minimum size of playing space
(2,400 square feet) is omitted in rule 1.
section 1. Rule 3, section 1, requires
a background of wood at least three
quarters of an inch thick for the bas
kets. Screens are no longer permitted.
The paying of the officials expenses in
serial championship games is no longer
mandatory.
An important change in rule 11, sec
tion 10. prohibits more than one player
of each team from tackling the ball at
the same time. A "dribble" is now
only counted such when the player ad
vances more than two steps wtiile roll-

ing or bouncing the ball.
The rule that in a dribble both hands
shall not be used simultaneously more
than once is still effective. Under rule
11, section 17, a man is not out of
bounds if only one foot is outside.
Players may be changed at any time
during the game (new rule 1, section
26). Last year's rules as well as the
new rules authorizes the referee to
award one point to the man fouled by
an opponent while trying for goal.
There was some doubt formerly as to
whether the team whose player was
fouled should also have a free throw
for goal.
The uew rules add that "this shall
noi interfere with a free throw for goal
from foul line," thus making It pos
sible to secure four points on this olio
play, if while being fouled the player
throws the goal, two points are scored,
oue point is awarded by the nfere
aud the ilayer is allowed an additional
free throw for the foul giving him uu
opiiortunity of scoring one point moro
if he throws the foul goal.
Under the old rules if a player threw
for goal from outside and missed thu
basket the ball went to the center,
while under the new rules the ball con
tinues to play. r
Under rule 12, section 1 and 4. tho
referee is required to promptly dis
qualify any player using profane or
abusive language.</text>

Dr. Sharp e Takes Side of
Player at Intercollegiate
Meeting.
LEAVE OUT ROUGHNESS
Too Many Tecnnicsfities It Claim of
Coaches and Players New
Role Affects Centers.
New York, Nov. 29. Exception to the
trend of collegiate Icglsla ion was voiced
In no uncertain terms at the annual inter
pretation .neetlng of the Intercollegiate
basket-ball rules committee at the Hotel
Astor yesterday afternoon Dr. A. II.
Sharpe, coach of the Cornell football,
basket-ball, and baseball teams, took the
side cf the plajer and coach against the
rules committee, which, he said, was con
cerning itself more with ruling on tech
nicalities than on the practical issues of
the game.
The discussion arose when Dr. Joseph
E. Ray croft chairman of the rules com
mittee, and the presiding officer, called
for the consideration of Rule 11, which Is
designed to penalize blocking. The rule
had been amended over summer so that it
read: "A player is entitled to take any
position on the court but if in taking a
position he faces an opponent or makes
bodily contact with an opponent so as to
interfere with the latter's progress he
Is blocking."
Dr. Raycrott said that the change had
been made In the rule 'as part of the
general plan of the rulemakers to elim
inate all unnecessary roughness and com
pel the plajers to "play the ball and not
the man." By this rule, said Dr. Ray
croft all Illegal Interference with a play
er by his opponent resulting from the
close guarding of pla, would be deemed
a foul and penalized as such.
Dr. Sharpe carried his point because.
when the discussion had been concluded
and a vote taken on the Interpretation of
the rule Dr. It ay croft and Ralph Mor
gan, of the University of Pennsylvania,
secretary of the committee, agreed to
permit an editorial correction which sub
stituted an "and" for the "or" in the
rule in question, making it mean that
only by direct bodily contact can a player
block his opponent
The most important changes In the rules
forthe coming year have to do with the
"Jump" ball and the ball when It goes
out of bounds. In order to eliminate the
fouling that so frequently happened under
the old Jump rule, the players Jumping
for the ball now, either In the center or
on any part of the floor will have to
Jump with one hands behind the back.
The meeting ruled that b behind the
back was meant behind any part V the
back below the shoulder, with the hand
touchihg the back, rather than the strict
working of the section, which compelled
the player to have on hand behind the
back at the waistline.
The other rule regarding the Jump ball
was aimed to do away with a great many
of the "Jumps" along the sideline after
the ball has been out of bounds by giv
ing it to the opponent of the man last
touched by It The rules relating to
dribbling were also discussed, but no rul
ing was made.</text>

Fine Gyms Make Basketball Second Only To
Football In Popularity
BY EVERETT S. DEAN
Basketball ('each. Indiana l'.
Basketball is recognized in most
of the country as the second major
sport. Its progress has come about
solely on its merits. Proximity of
the crowd to the players lias made
it possible for the crowd to experi
ence thrills which go with speedy
action more than in any other
j sport.
Pine gymnasiums and field houses
in many states are real testimony
I to the popularity of basketball. De
mand for seating space has led
larger towns to build gymnasiums
With seating capacities of 4000 to
5000. F.ne field houses with seat
1 ing capacity from 8000 to 15.000
have been built to meet the college
demand. Outstanding basketball
plants of the country are the
I Palestra at the University of
Pennsylvania, and most of the field
houses of Big Ten schools. The
Indiana State High School Basket
ball Tournament is played each
i year before 20.000 fans and offers
a great spectacle to sportdom.
Schedule making and tournament
f play in high shools have been
regulated by state athletic asso
ciations to the extent that high
school basketball is on a sounder
basis than ever before. Schedules
once consisted of 35 games, which
were too many for the high school
boy. In some states 18 to 20 games
now make up the schedules. The
strain of long tournaments has
been avoided by spreading tourn
aments over a period of three weeks
j instead of two.

Basketball has gone through dif
ferent evolutionary stages and with
each succeeding one the game is
becoming more scientific.
Few people are aware of how
universally the game Is played.
During the last few' weeks I have
received requests for basketball
lessons from the following coun
tries: Alaska. Porto Rico. Mexico.
Guam, and France Our service
teams have no doubt been the
greatest medium of spreading the
game.

Basketball is played In the fol-
lowing countries that we know of:
Alaska, Canadian Provinces, Hawaii.1
China. Japan. Porto Rico and oth
er South American countries, Cuba.
Panama. San Salvador. Spain.
Greece, Persia. Guam. England, j
France, Mexico and others.
In many of these countries the
game is played outside due mostly
to the warm climate. However,
playing facilities are increasing
with the popularity of the games
as manifested by an order received
from the Mexican government bv
the Nurre Plate Glass Company of
Bloomington. Ind., for four com
plete sets of glass bank boards.
Mexico sent a team to tour the
mid-west last year and it surprised
everyone with its ability.</text>

My FRED BODEKER
The remarkable popularity of bas
ketball during the past 10 years has
elevated the game to the position of
one of the foremast in American sports.
The past decade has witnessed a seem
ingly impossible growth In the basket
game and even experts are puzzled over
the problem.
Basketball has proven itself to be
one of the best sports in every way
that help the American people to
amuse themselvefe in,the gymnasium.
Basketball makes no uncertain de
mands on heart and lungs and on en
durance generally. Basketball is a
game. That’s all—only a game. It is
not a combat nor a battle nor a fight*
as some people would term it. It is
just a game.
Authorities have often repeated the
statement that basketball does more
to form a man's character than any
other sport. The period of adolescence
is the time when basketball and sim
ilar games are played and when life’s
habits are formed and the character
largely determined. Politics is a game
and so is almost any business, and the
people are merely players in the game.
And so is basketball—it is a game and
one of the best.
DEVELOPS THE BODY
Basketball develops many parts of
the human body. It develops alertness,
gelt-control, skill, speed and brings ev
ery part of the body into action. The
game arouses the interest and enthu
siasm of every spectator. The simplic
ity and small quantity of apparatus
required, together with other chief
qualifications of the game, make it
one of the most valuable of our com
petitive games.
Basketball belongs to the large fam-
ily of games originated to amuse the
American public. It was first started
in 1891. Dr. James A. Naismtth, now
a member of the collegiate basketball
rules committee, was an instructor at
the Springfield Y. M. C. A. Training
school and undertook to devise an in
door game which would develop man
kind. Basketball was at first very sim
ple. Since then, however, the game has
undergone complete revision; but bas
ketball lovers all over the nation owe
to Dr. Naismith the honor of “invent
ing’’ the game.
Since 1891 basketball has made mar
velous strides. The game was adopted
by colleges, high schools, athletic as
sociations in all parts of the country.
The big eastern colleges first fell in
line and soon the movement spread to
the south. Beading southern colleges
and institutions quickly adopted the
game and by 1900 basketball was a
game that was beginning to be played
by all important institutions.
GROWTH IN 1906
In 1906 the game began to grow even
more popular. Athletic clubs in all parts
of the south were producing teams and
tights were being staged for the
•'championships.” Not only in the south
was the game popular, but the middle
west and the eastern states were far
ahead. It Is roughly estimated that
something over an average of 60 teams
were being produced in every state in
the union or over 2400 teams were
playing organized basketball to say
nothing of the innumerable grammar
schools and independent teams that
numbered as many more.
But basketball did not stop its won
derful growth. The game has some un
seen power that attracted clubs, col
leges and schools to adopt it. As the
years passed the number playing the
game increased and by 1910 the num
ber playing in 1906. which was es
timated to have been over 240°, was
estimated to have been doubled, or
nearly 3000 teams. This does not
elude independent teams but omy
teams as high schools, athletic clubs,
colleges and other educational institu
tion
Dr. Joseph E. Raycroft. chairman of
he joint committee on basketball
ules. is quoted as saying that the
umber of teams playing basketball
I 1910 was over 7000. This, however,
considered by many to be too large,
onsidering that six men 5s ine aver
ge number of players on one team,
ver 42,000 men were playing in or
anlzed basketball in 1910.
In Alabama in 1906, the number of
tarns playing basketball was something
he 10 or less, which Included the Bir
slngham Athletic club, Birmingham
Ugh school, Mobile, Montgomery, and a
ew others. The effects of the growth
ver the nation took effect in Alabama
nd the number in 1910 jumped to nearly
3 teams. A few hight schools were
laying the game, being seriously handt
apped by the lack of an Indoor court,
phile almost every athletic club and
M. C. A. in the state was represented
y a team.
OVER 100 TEAMS
In 1*16, the beginning of the present
eason, which Is about to come to a very
uccessful close, the number playing in
his state Jumped to over 100. Over 60
igh schools are playing basketball, with
ImoBt 40 athletic clubs and other instl
utions of this kind. The game is played
y every grammar school In the larger
itles of the state, while countless teams,
.norganlzed as in the Y. M. C. A., and
lass teams of various educational ln
tltutions, are following the same exam
Not only in Alabama but in all parts
>t the country Is the game making
apld strides toward the top of the lad
ler as an indoor sport. The number
paying In the United States at the
n-esent is estimated to go over 23,000
earns, which means that about 156,600
leople are playing organized basketball
X this number Alabama can boast of
Jmoat 700 players, which, although be
nw a majority of the statee, is well in
he advanced list.
Add so it can be seen, Alabama with
ractically every other state in the' union
fast taking to basketball, and expert
rltlcs who have watched Its growth for

the highest individual point scorer in
last night's game, with 24 points to
his credit, though Williams with 20

	<text>How the Young People of New York
ltclux Strict Formality at
Badminton*
The Way in Which n Howlinjj swell
Getsilimsell Ip for the Ilariu
less Game.
New York Letter: 1 have read a heap
within a month in the society columns ot
our city dailies and weeklies, as well as in
out-of-town letters, concerning one Noa
Don. who seems to be accepted as the
spring-tide belle of Fifth avenue. Non
sense! This is too big a town, and even the
limits of the most pretentious society are
too spacious, to permit any single girl to
pet unquestioned supremacy. I have seen
this precious creature, moreover, and 1 am
telling you Cor keeps that she is no such
thing as the accounts make her out. I'm
not denying her all the wit at repartee to
iredited to her. She truly has touguc as
iliarp and quick as ever 1 heard: but what
I am impressing on you this minute- is that
a Queen of Swelldom, if we ever do crown
one. will be perfection as to dress.
Now. Noa Don is merely a traveled
and educated gill, who has been round the
world to pick up conceits that startle and
amuse us; who has come into New York
with family connections that give her en
trance to the charmed circles of wealth, and
«he makes her witty comments— as
nave been so extensively reported with
considerable cleverness; but when 1 have
described her as she presented herself at
the Academy of Music the other evening
yon will understand why I won't concede
that she ought to be elevated into public
view as supremely fine. She ought to huve
been arrayed in fashionable evening
costume, of course, because she sat in a box
along with women so dressed. But she ap
parently aimed to be
DISTISCTIVKLY ODD.
Her hair was loose and fluffy, and the
only ornamentation or attempt at coiifure
was a curious Bori of gilded thing not un
like a crown -set on the top of her head.
Her dress was pale amber >atm, and its cut
was not unlike that of the current morning
gown. Her anus wene completely covered
by sleeves and gloves, but her nmiapn was
law 111 a Bquariah shape, outlined by a
Btand-up frill of lace, as little in the fashion
cf Queen Elizabeth. No. no; Noa Don
can not be officially admired, no matter
how smart her sayings, until she robes her
self in accordance with strict fashiou's
rules.
What a jolly row Miss Cleveland has
been kicking up. by the way. about low
corsages. Still, she is awfully right in con
demning some of the nudity, and
you will remember that 1 have been
doing the same missionary sort of
work for several seasons. i*he makes
n special point of it that the line of bareness
shall bo high enough bo cover all of the dis
tinct feminity. He* Idea is that bare amis,
an. l so much Of the breast as happens to be
flat, are not an immodest exposure: but as I
looked up from the perusal of her letter— it
was just before Starting tor B recent ion. and
a bevy of tirls were randy to go— and my
eyes fell on a maiden of exceeding meager
nests in curvatures, I said to myself:
'•Where would the line be dra*vn across
that creature if it were lowered in obedience
to .Miss Cleveland's proposition?''
BOUBKHOLO AIM l( I.LS
are so frequently asked about by a*ycor
respondents that I here give, by general
way of answer, a number of points. Pil
low-shams arc used in preference to fancy
trimmed slip overs. Lace curtains never
go out of fashion. They I.re used for
parlors, reception and dlning-rooma,
bedrooms, and. in fact, for all the
rooms of a houso. if preferred to the many
novelties in what is called .Madras lace.
really a muslin brocbe curtain, in various
colors to suit the furnitures of the room for
which they are intended. The moat htfh*
[onablc watch chain worn is a short fob
chain, with a ball at the end. which inavbe
plain, chased or set with Jewels. We did
not know that they were called Queen
Anne watch-chains, but that is probably
the name by which they arc known to some
fashion writers and to jewelers. Grena
dines are BOperceded by canvas or etamine
fabrics nowadays, but are still worn by a
few conservative ladies. Great variety in
form and color of upholstery, draperies and
all the pieces of furniture in a room is per
mitted by fashion at present. In fact, what
is called by some writers the eloctric room
that is. a room furnished with choice
furniture representing various modern or
medieval periods of art furnishings, and
harmoniously combining several subdued
colors with one prevailing tint or tone is
considered the height of taste. But it re
quires
OHKA.T JUDGMENT
in selecting the pieces of furniture, the cur
tains, carpets, decorations and ornaments
of such a room. There is danger of mak
ing it look like a furniture dealer's collec
tion. The rage for decorated china, or
delft, is on the wane, but when plain white
is used it is selected of the finest ware, and
is sometimes made decorative in the fluting
or waving of the pieces in dotting, scallop
hie. denting or flagreting the edges, the
handles and borders of the cups, dishes,
sauces, plates and side pieces. The most
exquisite and fanciful shapes of antique,
niediseval and modern pottery are chosen,
all done in white. Then, if color is de
manded on the table, it is supplied by flow
ers, all one color if possible, by fancy col
ored glass and open drawn work lines in
the tablecloth, showing the bright color
of the fine flannel cloth placed under
the white one. Sometime a long mat
of velvet or plush of the color of the
flowers and glass on the table is placed
down the center of the same, and on this
are placed the eperjoie, a central glass etna
for tlowers and lruit, and the little bisque.
j tiuures holding btekete t;dl of bon-bons,

a critical view at a net which extended

dressing- rooms, and presently emerged in
all the glory ol white llaunel knickerbock-
ers and shirt, with long red stockings, a
blue nnd white silk Norfolk jacket, and a
blue worsted Tarn O'Shanter cap perched
artfully upon his rather peculiar-looking
head. Around one of his slim wrists there
was a broad leather band clasped with four
buckles a scheme by which champion
badminton aud tennis players strengthen
wrists that have been strained by overplay.
The single glass now hung over his breast.
He danced about fora moment to limber up
his legs, and then, stepping out in the iu
closure across which the net was placed,
he slipped oflE his little cube into which was inserted a rim
of feathers and tossed it in the air. When
it came diving downward, with bullet-like

ward the roof. With the rich colors of his
costume and his nimbleness he might have
been tnistaden by a buloonist peering from
above for a huge tropical bird of some cay
but gawky sort disporting itself grotesquely
in the sun.
THE SOLITARY
young; badminton player who was romping
so joyously was a howling swell of a very
high order. He didn't look like a man of
pint importance, but socially his position 1
is enviable. A man who at the age of j
twenty-eiirht can boast of membership in
the Summerset club, of Boston; the Savage
club, of London; the Jockey club of Paris,
and the Union. Knickerbocker and Union

gave a yell of meeting that was quite un

street Arab.
••Late again. Miss Agatha," he chirped,
happily. "Ton me soul it is quite heart
rending for a man of my conscientiousness
and t lustful nature to receive these disap
pointments every play-day."
''Indeed, you are a paragon,"' said the
jrirl. smiling brightly, and aoastaglsßf wraps

Ibis morning. She was desperately blue
when she irot out of bed, and so she climbed
bark in again. Then she insisted upon my
rending to her until she felt more composed,
and there you are."
She had scarcely finished speaking when
there was a great chatter and bustle about,
and half a dozen people hurried in. Two
of the guls were in full tennis rig. and
when one of the men slipped off his long
ulster he revealed the fact that he. too. had
put on his play-day togs before suiting
from home.
WHAT STRUCK ME HARDEST.
However, was the fact that the belles
were so much more shapely and graceful
than the beaux. More than one bony fellow
had on what 1 believe actors call "Mats."
That is to Kay, their legs were artificially
enlarged and straightened by padding. No

One when costuming for badminton or ten
nis. The fashion is to wear soft woolen
skirts retelling to the ankles, and presuma
bly with no petticoats underneath. The in
tention is to leave the legs clear for the ex
ercise—also distinctly outlined as part of
the mend symmetry that constitutes so
much of the pleasant sightliness of the
■port. Well, every player of good sense
puts on exactly as many flannel skirts as
will produce the desired bulk. No speota
toi can tell whether there be one or six lay
ers of the soft fabric; but anyhow he never
sees the protuberance of a knee-pan or the
sharpness of a shinboue. Clara Belle in

	<text>A GAME FOR ALL SEASONS.
It Is Called "liadiulnton" ud Cuuie From
England.
Badminton was invented, or origin
ated, whichever you please, in England,
but owes its present rules to the Ah
medabad Badminton club of India,
Which has practically revived the sport.
It is a modification of lawn tennis, with
some important differences, as will be
seen further on, and has the advantage
that it can be, and generally is, played
in-doors. This make3 it both a suramet
and winter game.
Tho dimensions of the court must be
decided in a great measure by the capa
bilities of the room in which the game
is played. Tho best size Is one twenty
eight feet long by twenty feet broad.
The courts should bo marked off by
means of pegs and strings, or better,
when possible, by white chalk lines oe
the floor, and divided in the following
way: At each end ol the ground are
two courts, ten feet square, while the
center is formed by a piece of neutral
ground eight feet broad by twenty feet
long. On each of these outer lines of
the neutral ground and in the center
are placed tho posts which support tho
net The net, which is two feet to two
feet six inches deep, is suspended at a
height of six feet from the ground, and
firmly held by guy ropes attached to
posts.
The racquets used in Badminton, to
be easily and quickly Wielded, should
be lighter than those used in lawn ten
nis, and consequently smaller. A shut
tlecock is used instead of a ball, and
may be large or small, according to tho
wish of the players.
In its general line, Badminton is a
game played in the same fashion as
lawn tennis, with tho exception that
from one to four persons may play on a
side, and that tho shuttlecock must be
returned on the volley. Tho shuttle
cock is served and returned under tho
same provisions, except that, of course,
if the shuttlecock falls on the ground,
it Is counted as a miss to the player
missing it, and to his side. The servico
shall be from the "service-corner," tho
server and receiver each standing with
both feet within their respective quad
rants until the shuttlecock is struck.
The divisions of the respective courts
are only observed in the serve or first
hit; after that, the partners may stand
where they please, on their side of tha
net The shuttlecock must be served
in such a way that it falls clear over the
net, without touching the net, ropes or
posts, and falls inside the lines of the
service-court If the net Is touched in
service and tho shuttlecock falls over,
the stroke is considered as a "let," and
does not count as a fault against the
person serving. In play, however, the
touching of the net by the shuttlecock,
when it falls over, is counted as good
stroke. If the net is touched by the
racquets of the players, or if they reach
over the net with their racquets, tho
stroke counts against them. Two faults
puts "hand out" In all cases a shuttle
Cock falling on any of the boundary
lines Is regarded as a fault, as if it had
fallen outside Of the boundary lines,
both in service and play.
Iifteen points constitute the game.
In service no overhand stroke is allow
ed. The shuttlecock is judged by where
it strikes and not by where it lies after
striking. In judging whether a player
has reached over tho net, the umpire
should bo careful to note if the shuttle
cock Is struck before it has crossed the
net and not by the racquet of the play
or, which is naturally carried forward
by the impetus of the stroke and which
might arrive at a slight angle over the
net, although the shuttlecock itself was
struck on the correct side. If, however,
the net is touched by the racquet the
stroke counts against the player, wheth
er the shuttlecock was struck on the
right side of the net or not
As will be seen from the description,
Badminton requires agility and a quick
eye, rather than great strength, and it
will be found to be a game at which
girls can play with pleasure and profit

badminton Has Not Driven
Tennis From Favor.
BOSSIP OF THE CHAMPIONS.
I y Mabel Cahill, the John L. Sullivan
•f the Xew York Club, and Other
i Great Flayers.
1
i jriw YORK. May 25.—[Special Corre
jpoodence.J—The tennis season of 1891 has
fairly begun, and from present appear
ances it will be the liveliest one that has
aver been known in this country. There
was a prospect earlier in the season that
badminton might supplant the older game
in favor, but every one concerned now
scouts the possibility of such a result. No
one, naturally, takes a keener interest in
the question than the makers of tennis
goods, and they report the largest advance
tale* on record. It is one of the not to be
forgotten consequences of the popularity
of lawn tennis that the manufacture and
nleof neta, rackets, lawn markers, shoes
and uniforms has become a great industry.
It is only a few years since all these goods
were imported from England, the home of
fee game; now they are practically all
Bade here, and th» business amounts to
something like $10,000,000 a year to the
trade. This is looking at the other side of
the sport, but the point of view is not an
unimportant one.
The clubs in and about New York are in
nnmfctr almost legion, and they are pre
paring busily for championship events,
mcticaliy the season begins with Decora
tion day, the month of fine weather before
that date being given np to practice play
ing. Of course, play begins earlier South.
The Washington City tournament for the
championship of the Southern states was
held in the middle of May. Tomorrow
the New York Tennis Club will hold its
spring games, and from now to the end of
the season in October there will be a
tournament every day—for not a summer
hotel of any size is without its tennis
courts, the smaJlest villages have their
clubs, and matches and return matches
t are shrewdly relied upon to keep up the
interest in the game.
Undoubtedly the success of tennis is
OLLIE CA MPBELL.
largely due to the fact that men and
women can play it together. For flirta
tion purposes it may not quite eoual the
sedate and sluggish game of croquet,
but for a judicious combination of
sport and opportunities for tete-a-tetes
its equal has never been invented.
Indeed, tennis is the ideal ladies' game.
As it requires agility rather than strength
to play tennis, there is no reason why
women should not play quite as well as
men, if it were not for the perpetual haudi
cap ot skirts. As it is, an active young
woman is about a match for a stout and
middle-aped man, with equal practice, and
some of the l>est women players can hold
their own with any but the very best men.
i his is a test not to be recommended,how
ever, as the practice of playing with one of
the other sex rather tends to break a man
up. as he is divided between his gallantry
and his desire to excel. Thus it may easily
happen that a man will show tip in better
form at the end of a season with compara
tively little practice with men than if he
had considerable careless playing with
women. Championship games are, of
course, always between players of the
•tne sex.

fi.>rdinary tennis player, met with a dis

"Ollie" Campbell, the present
bolder ot the championship, both having
park in past years,
though Mr. Slocum is ;IOR a member of
P:. George's Club, of New York. There is
perhaps no place in the country where bet
ter provision is made for tennis playing on
large scale than at Prospect park, and
there are few days in spring or summer
when a considerable number of games are
lot going on there simultaneously.

Miss Robinson, of Staten Island,
Mrs Morgan, of Short Hill*. N. J.,
the Misses Kiting. Frazer and Temple, of
Westchester county, and Miss Colby, of
Orange, N. J., are among the famous play
ers who may contert for the honors with
Miss< ah:i! and the Roosevelt sisters. Of
course, there will be dark horses, too, who
at the last moment mav appear to wrest
the leadership away from the well-known
plavers. It is always more difficult to
predict women's piaying than men's.
They have more time for practice, they
are quite as numerous, if not more so. and
they are far less likely to enter champion
ship contests than men, even if quite pro
ficient. Thus local pride may almost at
any time force to the front some splendid
player before unheard of outside of her
county. It is the peculiarity of the plav
ers of both sexes that they are at their
best while quite young and do jiotlong
retain their supremacy.
Badminton came to the front last winter
as an indoors game, for which it was well
adapted by the smallness of the court re
quired. A tennis court is 78 feet by 27
wider than an ordinary city lot and nearly
as deep. The badminton court is only 44
feet by 20, and can be recommended for a
home game where spare is verv limited.
The net is shorter and higher. The short
service line is 6 feet 6 inches from the net.
The base line is 15 feet t> inches farther
back on either side. The net itself is 16
feet long and 5 feet high in the middle.
In the play a shuttlecock is used in
stead of the white ball used in ten
nis. This is made of rubber and
feathered to steady its (light. Ordinary
tennis rackets are used instead of the ola
faehioned "battledores." The game is, in
fact, a sort of cross between lawn tennis
and the older game, and is said to be the
invention of an English officer in India,
who found the climate too hot for ten
nis. Perhaps that is the reason why old
tennis players call badminton a lazy peo-
Sle's When such sturdy at hletes as
[amihon Cary and .Stanley Mortimer and
such clever tennis experts as Miss Annie
Webb, Miss Turnure, Miss Minturn and
Miss Elsie Mitchell play and enjoy thgame, however, it can safely he assumed
that, there is plenty of exercise in it.
The rules of badminton are so simple
that they can be summarized in a para
graph. There is no authoritative Ameri
can body like the National Tennis Associ
ation, but the English rules are used:
The sides toss for choiceof ends or service
before the first game of a match, and change
to the other sideof the netafter each game.
The single-handed and double-handed
game consists of fifteen ares. At "13 all,"
the side which first reaches thirteen has
the option of "setting^'five; at 14 all, of
setting three. In three-handed or four-
handed jrames the game consists of twenty
one aces. First set is at 19 all; second at
20 all. A fault made by a player whose
I side is in puts a baud out; if made by a
j player whose side is out it counts an afe to
i the in side. It is a fault if the service is
I "overhand"; if the rirs-t part of the path of
the shuttlecock is inclined downward ;if the
service falls into the wrong court; if the ser
vice falls short of the service line or outside
the bounding line; unless both the server's
teet are in his own court; if the shuttle
cock falls outside the bounds of the court;
if the shuttlecock does not pass between
the posts, or if it pass under or through
tiie net or touch anything except the bat
of the striker, or the top of the net if the
shuttlecock !>e hit twice intentionally by
tiie same player; if the shuttlecock be
struck before it crosses the striker's side of
i the net; if the striker touch the net or its
supports with his racket or otherwise,
i The player in the right-hand court com
mencea the game by serving to the plaver
in the adverse right-hand oourt; if tfiat
leaver return the shuttlecock, it must be
hit ack by the in side and then returned
by the out side till a fault is made by one
j side or the other. The game is continued
in this manner, count being chanced after
j each ace ;s made. The service lines nre
disregarded alter the serve is returned,
j Iho innings always begin with the player
j in the right-hand court, and serves arc
i made alternately from each court into the
one d. t.; iia.lv opposite. In two. three
and tour-handed games, the side begin
ning a game has only one hand in its nrst
innings if there are two a side, and only
two hands if there are three a side. Inatwo
h and el game only the ptrson served to may
take a serve; not so in a three or four
handed game. The service must not begin
till the opponent is ready, but any attempt
to return is taken to indicate readiness.
Any unforseen or accidental hindrance
may be given by a "let" bv the umpire on
appeal from either side "before the next
service commences or before the players
have changed sides at the end of a game.
A "let" cannot be claimed it" an attempt
I ha* been made to strike the shuttlecock
Pitiably the next winter there will be a
badminton association iu this country r or
the new game may he taken under the

|J Ij inatcd, whichever you please, in

RtjlSSSfj to the Ahmedabad Badminton Club,
Mvlfilr" o f India, which has practically re
vived the sport. It is a modification
of lawn tennis, with some important differ
ences, as will be seen further on, and has the
advantage that it can be,- and generally is,
played indoors. This makes it both a sum
mer and winter game.
The dimensions of the court Imuit be de
cided in a grjfat measure by the j capabilities
of the room in, which the game lis played.
The best size ii one 28 feet long- by 20 feet
broad. The courts should be marked off by
means of pegs and strings, 'or better, when,
possible, by white chalk lines jon j the floor,
and divided in the following way: At each
end of the ground axe two courts. L jlO feet
square, while the centre is formed by a piece
of neutral ground 8 feet broad by 20 feet long.
On each of the outer lines of the neutral
I ground and in the centre are placed the posts
which support the net. .C-
The net, which is 2 feet to 2l2 l feet 6 inches
deep, is suspended at a height of 6 feet from
the ground, and firmly held by. guy ropes at
i tached to posts. ,y L
1 The racquets used in Badminton, to be easily
and quickly wielded, should be lighter than
those used in lawn tennis, and consequently
smaller. A shuttlecock is used instead of a
ball, and may be large or small, accorum" to
the 'wish of the players. .7 .1
In its general; line, Badminton is a game
played in the same fashion': as lawn tenni*,
with the exception that from one to four
persons may play on a side, and that the shut
tlecock must be returned on the volley. -_•
The shuttlecock is served and returned
under the same provisions, except that, of
i course if the shuttlecock falls on the ground,
it is counted as a miss to. the player missing
it and to his side." The service shall be from
the "service-corner," the server I and receiver
each standing with both feet within their
respective quadrants until the shuttlecock v
struck.
The divisions of the respective courts are
only observed in the serve or first hit; after
that the partners may 1 stand where they
please, on their side of the ¦net....
The shuttlecock must be served in Mich a
wav that it falls clear over the net. without
touching the net, ropes or posts, and falls in
ide the lines of the service court.
If the net is touched m service and the
shuttlecock falls over, the stroke is oonsid

At tltc first tfelfOi 'crawAe&6>r J fyr/ff£ Jttf/a /}&3&7ered 38 a "let," and does not count us a fault
against tbe person serving.
In play, however, the touching of the net
by the shuttlecock, when it falls over, is
counted as good stroke.
If the net is touched by the racquets of the
players, or if they reach over the ne£_ with
their racquets, the stroke counts against
them.
Two faultf puts "hand out." In all cases
a shuttlecock falling on any of the boundary
lines is regarded as a fault, as if it had fallen
outside of the boundary lines, both in service
and play.
Fifteen points constitute the game. In ser
vice no overhand stroke is allowed.
The shuttlecock is judged by where it strikes
and not by where it lies after striking.
In judging whether a player has reached
ever the net, the umpire should be careful to
note if the shuttlecock is struck before it
has crossed the net and not by the racquet of
the player, which is naturally carried forward
by the impetus of the stroke and which might
arrive at a slight angle over the net. although
the -shuttlecock itself was struck fairly on the
correct side.
If, however, the net is touched by the
racquet the stroke counts against the player,
whether the shuttlecock was struck on the
right side of the net or not.
As will be st%n from the description, Bad
minton requires agility and a quick eye, rather
than great strength, and it will be found to
be a game at which girls can play with pleas

	<text>Badminton Threatens
Ping Pong’s VoQiie j
Badminton Is coming Into vogue again
In a way that promises to lay ping pong
on the shelf as a society game. English
social lights, which took so devotedly to
ping pong have begun to serve notice that
Badminton is in better taste, and a so
cial organ says of the game, “Badminton
can be played out of doors, on a lawn or
on a carriage drive, or indoors in a
large room. Two, three, four, six or
eight may play at once. The best game,
however, is six, when there are two wom
en up at each side of the net while a
man keeps back behind them. The game, j
as might be expected, derived its name
from the fact that it was first introduced j
in England by a member of a house par- j
ty at Badminton in the time of the late I
Duke of Beaufort.
Sober tennis players who had scorned
ping pong as something immeasurably
less than tennis may incline toward Bad
minton, though it, too, may be reduced
to indoor quarters. For. with the excep
tion of the balls used. Badminton is ten
nis. its plays and scores being observed
according to the same rules, and only
the lack of the rebounding quality in the
bails differing from tennis.
The ball used is the shuttlecock that
goes with the game of battledore. It is a
ball of cork, weighted with lead, or it
may be hard rubber, and in either case
it is winged with feathers, which causes
the ball to revolve, at the same time
flying swiftly, guided by the feather
wings. As the ball will not rebound when
striking the earth or floor, it must be
“volleyed," and each failure to return
the ball is counted against the player
who misses.
For playing Badminton the best court 1
is 28 feet long and 20 feet wide, with the; j
service line ten feet from the base line.
A net one foot deep is stretchd across
the court five and a half feet above the
ground.
Only in the fact that these hard balls j
are winged, do not rebound, and have to I
be “volleyed,” does the game differ from
tennis. In this volleying, however, is the
tension and strained interest for both
player and spectator, and as a rival for
ping pong it looks as if society needed
only to pass the word to effect the
change.</text>

that promises to be the most »uccewful
of the hind Montgomery has ever haa.
Will be on. The indication* arc that
there will bo a record breaWng crowd
for. aside from the fact that It is the
first of the league games the two teams,
the Falcons and Independents, are both
verv popular with a large following, both
making great reputations in the baseball
line last summer.
The patrons of the game will find
grounds, grand stand and bleachers n
as sehlpshape order as if professional nail
was being played. Yesterday a set of reg
ulation basts and a regulation rubber
borne plate were received. U
few people are aware of thefaettbat
the 190- home plate is responsible for the
phenomenal games being put up' W
pitchers in the different professional
leagues. The plate this season, instead
Iff being S'tuare is a kind of a triangle
and instead of a 12-inch front faring the
pin her It is 17 inches. I his gives the
pitcher five inches more play and he haa
all aorta of chances to cut the corners, a
great advantage to the man in the box
and a corresponding disadvantage to the
batter.
The street railway company yesterday
morning sent a big roller and mower out
to the grounds and President. Screws
had the infield thoroughly rolled and
packed and the grass in the outfield cu%
out. The street railway people are re
pairing the fences, wire-netting in the
grandstand and everything else that
needs repairs. They say that they will
have all the cars needed to take any kind
of crowd out to the games and bring
them home comfortably. A substantial
stand was being built yesterday for the
Infirmary Aid and will he ready by Sat
urday's game
One hour's hard practice a day has been
put in all this week by the Falcons and
Independents, and when they get on the
field Saturday both teams will be in the
pink of condition. After Saturday s game
the next league game will probably be
between the Gersts and Millers, the game
to be played for the benefit of the Confed
erate Soldiers' Home at Mountain Creek,
he President will be glad to heard from
ensacola. Columbus and any of the out
f-town teams.
The Memphis Commercial-Appeal has
the following:
Those who invested in the future pay
or play betting on the American Derby,
bai king Abo Frank. G. C. Bennett’s colt
to win that classic, had just as well make
up their minds to part with the amounts
they wagered. Abe Frank has raced in a
manner since leaving Memphis to cause
a majority of those who backed him at
long odds during the winter to abandon
inv idea of cashing their bets for the
American Derby. There are still a few.
however, that cling to the adage of
"where there is life there is hope.
A letter received here yesterday from
G. C .Bennett says that Abe Frank has
started in his last IVrhy. He will not be
imong the field that faces the starter
n the American Derby a week from next
Saturday, and he will never be sent after
mother Derby. Mr. Bennett draws the
line on Derbies now and will go after :i
ear-old stakes, which are not featured
is Derbies.
The determination of Bennett to keep
Abe Frank out of the American Derby
will cause much tearing of tickets It:

Mr. Bennett holds tickets aggregatinj

mcr souvenirs of the winter Americai
Derby favorite.
Two big races will be run Saturday. th<
Suburban Handicap it Sheepshead pa;
md the St. Louis Derby.
This ear's St. Louis Derby will b<
one of the m »"t valuable year-old stake
decided «>n the American turf this sea
sou with th®. exception of the Lawrenc
Realisation and the American Derby. The
Iaiwrenee Realisation, which is run at
Coney Island. *s worth about $30,000. while
the American Dert>y at Washington Park
has $20,000 added. The at. Louis Derby
will be worth about $15,000. This makes
It more valuable than either the Brook
lyn or Suburban handicaps. The 8t. Louis
Derby is a tjfie-honorcd classic with an
exceedingly Interesting history. It was
established in 1882. the year the present
Fair Grounds track was thrown open to
the public. B. C. Pate's Monogram won
the first St. Louis Derby, which was
worth $1,975 to the winner. In 1892 the
stake was abolished, but in 1896 was re
vived again under a different name, being
known as the National Derby. Prince
Lief won the stake in 1896. It had a
guaranteed value of $20,000 that year. In
1897 the stake was rechristened the St.
Louis Derby. It was worth $10,000 and
was captured by Ornament. John W.
Schorr has taken the last two Derbies,
with Sam Phillips in 1900 and Silverdale
in 1901. He will not have a starter this
year.
An Eastern tipster whose system is
"play the long shots.” advises against
the first choices by calling attention to
the downfall of favorites In 1901 and 1902
as follows:
In 1901:
Metropolitan. Starbright, 2 to 1. Lost.
Brooklyn Handicap. Banaster. 8 to 5,
Nit.
Suburban Handicap. Ethelbert, 7 to 6.
Trut.
Brighton Handicap, Alceds. 2 to 1,
Foozeled.
Futurity. Nasturtium. 2 to 1. No score.
Realization. Commando, 1 to 10. Got
the rinky-dink.
In 1902:
Carter Handicap, Himself, 7 to 5.
Dumped.
Metropolitan, Herbert. Down and out.
Withers. 0*4 Epgland. 2 to 1. Didn’t.
Belmont, Compute, 2 to 1. Flung high
and dry.
Jockey Club Stakes, Heno, 7 to 10.
Went wrong.
Brooklyn Handicap. Advance Guard, 2
to 1. Hard luck.
English Derby, Scepter, 7 to 2. Too
much touting.
Badminton is coming Into vogue again
in a way that promises to lay ping pong
on the shelf air a society game. English
social lights, which took so devotedly to
ping pong, have begun to serve notice
that Badminton is in better taste, and a
social organ says of the game: “Bad
minton can be played out of doors, on
a lawn or on a carriage drive, and in
doors in a large room. Two. three, four,
six or eight may play at once. The game,
however, is six. when there are two wo
men up at each side of the net while a
man keeps back behind them. The game,
as might be expected, derived its name
from the fart that it was first intro
duced in England by a member of a
house,.party at Badminton in the time
of the late Duke of Beaufort.”
Sober tennis players who have scorned
ping pong as sometimes immeasurably
less than tennis may incline towards
Badminton, though it. too, nay he re
duced to indoor quirters. For. with the
exception of the balls used. Badminton is
tennis. Its plays and scores being oh
served according to the same rules, an-1
only the lack of the rebounding quality
in the balls differing from tennis.
The ball used is the shuttlecock that
goes with the gamr of battledore. It is a
ball of cork, weighted with lead, or it
may he hard robber, and in either case it
is winged with feathers, which causes
the hall to revolve, at the same time
flying swiftly, guided by, th$ feather
wings. As the ball will not rebound when
striking the earth or floor, it must be
“volleyed.” and each failure to return
the ball is counted against the player
who misses.
Only in the fact that these hard halls
are winged, do not rebound, and have to
be "volleyed.” does the game dffTer from
tennis. Tn this volleying, however, is the
tension and strained interest for both
played and spectator, and as a rival for
ping pong it looks as 1f society needed
only to pass the word to effect the
change.</text>

ly Morris Weiner
and a kid who was beginning to
show an aptitude with the tennis
racket. At that time, in tourna
ments in Philadalphia, those who
watched him closely were con
vinced that they saw symptoms of
excellence.
Last year, while still a junior
performer, this Pasadena young
ster returned to New York. On
that occasion there was no un
certainty about his high-geared
play at badminton. He had ironed
out the rough spots, profiting by
his knowledge that tennis had
yielded him in the National junior
championships at Culver, Indiana.
He won the junior title two years
ago and last year was succeeded
by his chief rival on the Pacific
Coast, Ted Shroeder.
No other American performer
with the tennis racket and bad
minton bat has ever scaled the
heights Freeman has attained. He
was a star of the first magnitude
in the national badminton cham
pionships in New York last year.
His blend of tennis and badmin
ton was smooth, according to the
experts, and in the recent shut
tlecock championship at Seattle
Freeman was the whole show, ta
king no fewer than three national
championships.
He is so strong at both games
that the Californian looms as the
overpowering force in any cham
pionship at either game. It is al
so interesting to observe that
Freeman trounced Hank Prusoff
at badminton in the latter’s home
town, thereby retaliating for the
defeat suffered at Forest Hills
last season at the hands of the
lad who went on to rate thirteenth
in the Nationals.
....By the way, the record books
also reveal that Davis Freeman is
the first Californian who has
achieved the highest honor in this
respect. He has made a record at
badminton which few can equal
and which only one other player
in the country has been able to
equal thus far. Freeman made
grand slam in singles and doubles.
The only player to do that hith
erto was Mrs. Del Barkhuff then
of Seattle and now of Honolulu,
who did the triple victory back in
1937, when this national event
was inaugurated in Chicago.
At a recent badminton tourna
ment, Dave was awarded the top
seeding, as champion, in singles,
He took that event with scarcely
any formidable opposition, suc
cesfully defending his crown as
there was no opponent capable of
taking him into camp.
And here you have the reasons
for it. He’s amazingly fast on
his feet, quick of anticipation and
durable for a long session. Speed,
stamina and sense three prere
quisites of the tennis player.
Freeman has made it evident
that he has what it takes in bad
minton and tennis to rate as a na
tional champion and to justify his
sponsor’s predictions that in him
we have a future Davis Cup play
er and what is more the first Jew
ish Davis Cup player in America.
Judge Hardy, former interna
tional Davis Cup team captain,
who is pushing Dave’s tennis as
pirations wrote in the U. S. Lawn
Tennis Journal only last month:
“Freeman has shown remark
able ability to round out his ten
nis stronkes. This makes him par
ticularly dangerous in the fore
court, repeatedly turning defen-</text>

	<text>Game Of Badminton
Takes Camp Davis
Personnel By Storm
Badminton, originated by British
army officers in India 98 years
ago, has taken Camp Davis by
storm. Scores of soldiers are play
ing the game every night in the
week, making use of the courts at
Farnsworth Hall.
The craze has gained such im
petus that it has been necessary
to move the bleachers in the sports
arena to make room for additional
courts.
The athletic office loans out
rackets and sells the birds, or shut,
tlecocks at cost to the players.
Similar to tennis, badminton is
played with lighter rackets and in
stead of a ball the shuttlecock is
used.
The shuttlecock is made of feath
ers inserted and cemented in a
half sphere of cork. Object of the
game is to keep the “bird” in
the air. Nets, higher than those
used in tennis, are strung across
the badminton courts.
Among the officers of Camp Da
vis who can be classed (more or
less) as experts at badminton are
Major J. B. Yost; Lieut. R. F.
Bailey, and Lieut H. A. Johnson.</text>
