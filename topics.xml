When a ball goes out of bounds it is put in
play in the same way as in a foot ball game.
The game consists of two halft of twenty
minutes each or such time as the captains may
decide on. and time is taken out for delays.
A goal counts three points and a foul one
point for the opponent. and a majority of the
points decides the game.
There are a referee and umpire, whose duties
are the same respectively as the same officials
in a foot ball game.
Any player has a right to get the ball at any
time while it is in the field of play. provided
that he handles only the ball and not the op
ponent.
ADVANTAGEs OF THE GAME.
To an observer the game seemed to be one
that will solve the problem, which has been a
knotty one for some time, of introdncing a
game which will meet the excitement incident
to most outdoor sports and at the same time
be suitable for indoor play. At present when
the outdoor season closes most of the athletes
drop tbe sports in which they have been in
terested and the benefits thev derived from
them are lost. This game is one that requires
skill and agility. but strength is not one of the
necessary factors. and, consequently. men of
all physical conditions can take part in it. It
has also been found to have been a useful
sport for girls and women, as it is especially
APTEn THE FALL.
adapted to securing good health without having
the nervous strain caused by some of the
sports now indulged in.
In its principli. it is a combination of foot
ball and lacrosse. It resembles foot ball in
most of the rulings, but in the method to be
pursued to obtain a goal the game more closely
resembles lacrosse. Although at first glance it
would hardly seem possible to have any amount
of team play in the game, still it is only by the
concerted action that a team can play to the
beet advantage. A novice in the game inva
riably feels disposed when he obtains the ball
to make a shot for the goal, which could not be
made from any distance one time in a hundred,
as in order that the ball should remain in the
basket it has to be skillfully and easily tossed,
not thrown. A good player will. when he has
the ball, quickly look for one of his own team
who is in an uncovered position to whom he
can tos it. In this way a well-drilled team
could almost entirely keep the ball from the
hands of a team made up of new men. Quick
ness of eye, hand and foot is one of the first
requisites for a good player, and he also must
keep his head about him. A moment's hesita
tion or a wrong pass may give considerable
advantage to the other side.
If an umpire is chosen who strictly follows
the rules of the game there is little chance for
any roughness, as running with the ball is
prohibited, and thus the injuries coming from
sharp tackling in foot bal are done away with.
The attention of the player is fastened on the
ball and personal feeling in the matter is lost
sight of. The object of each player when one
of his side obtains the ball is to place himself
in an uncovered position so that one of his own
team can pays it to him, while the opponents
should in this eae stick closely to the men
with whom they are paired so that a pass to
them would gave an equal opportunity for each
to catch the ball. It is in this respect that
cool-beadedt.euand quickness count. Idi
vidlual play on the part of one man will destroy
all the good work that the rest of the team may
do. If the game in played indoors in a gym
naisium the passee should be more of a toes
rather than hard straight throw.
As the game has apparently obtained a good
foothold in this city and as it is a healthful and
at the same times exciting sport it is to be
hoped that the efforts of Mr. Joyce to make the
game a popular one in this city will meet with
success, Some of the men under him are bo
conming quite proficient and before long he will
have a iirst-class team,</text>

	<text>THE GAME OF BASKET BALL.
Interesting and Exciting Sport For Thos
Not Able to Exercise Kegularly.
The unnounceinent that at a woman's
educational institution not far from this
city tho students played a close and ex
citing game of "basket ball" wasperhaia
the first item which attracted public at
tention to a sport that is rapidly becom
ing very popular in this country among
those who have neither the physique nor
the taste for baseball or football. The
rules of the new sport are comparatively
simple, and the ease with which the
fundamental laws of the game can be
acquired in a few minutes' practice have
served to make it popular wherever it
has been introduced, while its freedom
from much of the roughness and intri
cacy of football has also tended to make
the devotees of basket ball enthusiastic
in their praise of its merits.
The name "basket ball" is derived from
the fact that scores are made not by car
rying the ball across the goal lines or
kicking it over the goal bar as in foot
ball, but by throwing the spheroid into I
a moderately small basket, which is hung
about 10 feet above the ground or floor.
To accomplish Buch a feat usually re
quires much practice, and as a rule tho
try at goals are far more numerous than
tho scores. Either hand or both hands
can be used in holding the ball, and it
must either he thrown or be batted with
tho open hand a punch with the fist or
arm, or a kick, constituting a foul.
The game differs from football also in
tho fact that no player is allowed to run
with the ball, but must stand where it is
caught, and a fair catch can be made
only with the hands. If the ball is held
for an unnecessarily long time, the um
pire takes possession of it and puts it
"ia play" by throwing it in the air, no
player being allowed to touch it in such
an event until it has struck the ground.
If a ball goes out of bounds, it is put in
play as in football, and no player is "off
sido," but every player has the right to
touch the ball anywhere or everywhere
in the game, provided the ball is in play.
No pushing, tripping, 6hoving or tac
kling is allowed, and every such offense
constitutes a foul, which gives one point
to the opposing nine. As a goal counts
but threo points and a foul one. there is
every incentive to avoid rough play. The
players advance the ball by tossing it to
some member of their own nine, and
there is the best opportunity for success
in personal skill combined with good
team play. The "forwards" and "cen
ters" usually toss the ball forward, but
when it gets dangerously near his own
goal, the goalkeeper often bats it with
tho open palm.
Ono advantago which basket ball has
over many other forms of popular sport
lies in tho fact that, while it allows 18
players to participate, it can be pursued
tho year round in tho open air during
tho warmer months and in the gymna
sium whilo cold weather prevails. Again,
basket ball can be played by persons
whose physique is not of tho most robust
type, although many athletes also have
found, in it a healthful form of exercise.
It has pypved of great value In furnish
ing exercise for business men, women
and children, as wpll as brawny students,
and from the general success it has al
ready attained wherever it has been in
troduced there is every probability that
basket ball will soon become a very popu
lar and widespread form of outdoor and
indoor sport. Boston Advertiser.</text>

	<text>BASKET BALL.
Those who were interested in the
basket ball games played last winter
will be pleased to learn that the town
and school boys are tohaveonemore
battle for the supremacy. A word
about the game which has become so
popular in the past few years will
be interesting to those who enjoy
good honest sport.
Basket ball was invented in 1889 by
ames Nuismith, teacher in the interna
tional training school, Springfield. Dur
ing its first season it wasnot particularly
popular hut has gained in favor and may
now be called quite as important sport in
the Y. M. C. A. world as football and
baseball, but it is essentially an indoor
game and the interest that is excited in
an exercise confined to the gymnasium
can perhaps never equal the zest which is
thrown into a game like football, played
under the blue of heaven, in the fresh out
door atmosphere and sun's rays that seem
to penetrate the muscles ot the athlete
and impart added vivacity. However,
at the season when football bruises have
long ago healed and conquests on the
gridiron are matters for rumination, he
who sighs for the pigskin can find much
satisfaction in basket ball, it possessing
all the elements of football but, if rules
are enforced, lacking the excessive rough
ness. The ball used is perlcctly round,
made of a rubber bladder, covered with
leather and is about a foot in diameter.
Briefly outlined the game according to
official rules for 1805, is played as follows:
baskets especially constructed tor the
purpose, are placed in a vertical position
with the mouth ten feetlrom the ground,
one at each end of the field (gymnasium),
occupying much the same position in re
lation to the players as do football goals.
i ne competitive teams tane positions on
the field as in football, save that there is
no line-up, The teams are composed of
five men when the playing space is less
than 1800 square feet, seven when it is
more than 1800 and less than 3600 and
nine men when over 3600. The referee,
with a player from each side, takes posi
tion in the center. He puts the ball in
play by throwing it up. Which side has
first ball depends on which center man
secures it. The ball is not kicked or
struck with the fists but thrown or batted
with the flat of the hand and the object
is, to get it into the basket, doing which
scores a goal. On the number of goals
secured depends the victory. The net
work of rules which govern the action of
the game is quite as elaborate as football
and will not be given here. Suffice it to
say that spectators easily comprehend
its action. The putting of a ball into the
basket may seem a veryeasv thing to do
but as a matter of fact it is very difficult
to acomplish with the floor empty and,
of course, much more so when two teams
are at strife. One of the rules says that
the ball shall always be kept in motion.
Two twenty-minute halves are played
with a rest of ten minutes between "the
halves. This is the time of actual play.
Each side has itscaptain while position
is the same as in baseball. The referee is
judge of the ball. He is the superior offi
cer ot the game and decides all questions
uul ucuimciy lulling on me umpire, i lie
umpire is judge of the men, calls all fouls,
notifies the offenders and has power to
disqualify men.
The game which was to be played
on Thursdayevening of this week has
been postponed until Saturday even
ing. The two teams have been prac
tising faithfully and will be able to
play a very interesting game. It is
hoped that the public will turn out
and encourage the gymnasts, as all
the proceeds over and above the ex
penses are to go towards much need
ed new apparatus for thegymnasium.</text>

BERKELEY, Cal., April I.— The Berke

LAWRENCE. KAS.. Dec. 17.-(SpeciaU
The basket ball "fever" has broken out
In Its most violent form among Kansas
university people. Dr. Naismith. the new
physical director, brought the germs with
him, and that they were healthy specimens
is evidenced by their activity.
At first only a few of the students siw
in basket ball the diversion. But the dis
ease spread rapidly. Not only doe- eai h
class already possess its basket ball team,
but the literary and the scientific men of
the faculty are backing their "crack fives.
Eve-ry evening the gymnasium is filled with
a scrambling mass of humanity, and the
spectators who can recognlz. a friend or
acquaintance In the melee must be gifterd
with second sight.
Five men compose a team at basket ball.
The floor Is divided into three parts. Tho
center men of the plaving teams oe-upy a
space chalked off in the middle, am, the
other four dispose themselves In various
graceful attitudes in the end sections. The
referee tosses up the ball just above the
heads of the centers, who are standing
face to face. Each makes a jump and en
deavors to hit the hall, knocking it over
to his own men and toward his goal. Then,
the scramble begins. The accomplished,
and gentlemanly contortionist in the pat
ent medicine show could not rival basket
ball players In the way of tying French
knots in their corporal systems. The ma.-s
of writhing humanity turns over and over
in kaleidoscopic fashion, suddenly un
winds itself and is again resolved Into
parts. A man goes diving after the ball
and comos triumphantly up out of the
fray with his arms full of another man's
head! The aim In playing basket ball, so
it Is claimed. Is to throw the ball Into tho
round baskets, suspended at each end ot
the field, a greater number of times than
the opposing players. In reality, however,
it would seem that the cherls-hed object of
each plajer was to make as large and
choice collection of hruises as possible.
But that is basket ball from the specta
tor's point of view. To the players It Is
an all absorbing sport. Some of them
even have the audacity to assert that It Isi
a "gentle game, don't you know." Gentle,
indeed! One might as appropriately speak
of a bucking broncho as "well-mannered."
When the field Is not divided into sec
tions the game is reallr rough, but If thi
chalk lines are drawn, and fouls are faith
fully called whenever a man over-teps.
his boundaries, the bruise hunter adds to
Ills collection more slowly. It Is amusing:
to watch the players trying to remember
to have the proper respect for the bound
aries. Indeed It is truly pathetic to sej
what limitations of power a simple chalk
line can put on thee great, strong athletes.
In actual agony they har.g over the edge
and reach out helpless, longing arms to
ward the ball. Now and then an unruly
foot goes across the line, and then the
sharp whistle of the referee Is heard. A
foul entitles the players ort the otht.r side
a chance at throwing goal.
The game consists of two halves of
twenty minutes each. A twenty minute
rest is given between, and a new- team
put on to utilize the rest time. Each time
the ball goes Into the basket two points
are scored for the side whose goal Is
thrown As In baseball, a small score
Indicates a good game.
The Inventor of Ilnsket Hnll.
Dr. James Naismith Is the inventor of
basket ball. Unlike most of our games It
Is not the development of some medieval
sport. It was worked out on scientific
principles to meet a long felt want. Dr.
Naismith was physical director of a Y.
31. C. A. training school at Springfield.
Mass.. where the problem of supplying thlsj
need was brought to him for solution.
Busket ball was the result. It was In the
winter of 9I-52 that the game was intro
duced. The rules were made out and hung
In the "gym" fdr the inspection of playerj
before the game was ever tried. The men
were a little skeptical "at first about it.
but after the; ball was once thrown up no
coaxing was needed to Induce them to
Play. Basket ball came Into general favor
first through the Y. M. C. A. Having been
Introduced through the association it was
natural that it should spread through that
medium. Before long, however, colleges be
gan to investigate and adopt the game, ami
In the short .-pace of seven yeirs It has

colleges, both for men anil for womn.
basket ball Is the reigning favorite among
sports. The rules are not changed for tho
young women players, though doubtless the
game is played with a bit more tenderness.
Though at first sight the game appears
to be a free for all scramble. It soon be
comes evident that a number of sclentiilr?
,1'laya are iossibIe. Unfailing good judg
ment, anu goon muscular control are the
first requisites for a good player. The treat
ment of the ball Is the subject of several
rules. It can be tossed, rolled on Ihe floor
and pushed around, but must never In
kicked. There are no signals, and a play
lasts until the ball Is passed Into the basket.

The Kansas university men are going to
be great basket ball enthusiasts. Each
class has a picked team, and places on thei
teams are as much sought as on the var
sity eleven. Among faculty members thero
are two teams the Snow hall and tho
Frazer hall, representing the scientists and
the literary men. On the former team
Dr. WHHston. Marshall Barber. Clarenco
McClung. A. H. Clark and Dr. Naismith
hold positions. Their opponents are A.
G. Cantield. AY. H. Carruth. E. M. Hop
kins. M. W. Sterling and Archie Hogg.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3 p. m. thesj
distinguished individuals lay aside their
dignity and their collars, don sweaters anil
pugilistic airs, and come forth into the
arena to dw battle. With a grace that
is acciuired only through long years of
bending over desks and laboratory tables,
they scamiier now here, now there, after
the elusive canvas sphere.
When the faculty teams met for their
last practice. Chancellor Snow- appeared.
He was Immediately besieged to play. The
chancellor protested that he was too green,
but such fetching invitations could never
be turned dotvn. The head of the universi
ty disappeared Into a dressing room, and
In a few moments, he emerged In a cos
tume of which the most noticeable feat
ures were- white canvas shoes, a seraphic:
grin, and a neutral tinted sweater. With
characteristic vigor he attacked the game,
and before long he was the champion play
er. There is nothing slow about the chan
cellor when he gets into action.
Tournament in January.
On January 13 an Indoor tournament will
be given. Basket hall will be the chief
feature of the c-xhihltlon. The old skat
ing rink on Kentucky street will probably
be rented for the occasion. Dr. Naismltii
says he enjoys working with college men
far better than with others. He believes
there is no artificiality whatever about e-ol-Iege
students. "If a man is a man they
will respect him and his endeavors in their
behalf." he says, "but they won t Stan. I
trilling a minute. When I find it yo'ing
fellow who kicks on the referee's decision-..
I just ask him n call fouls for a few mo
ments. After he has called a few and other
men have kicked on his rulings, h,. never
kicks again."
Pr. Naismith has much influence t
the young men in his charge. In Mrs. Cora
McColli,m Smith he has an able colleague.
The revolution In feeling which a few yearn
have brought about among the physical
culture students Is remarkable. When the
training was first Introduced about four
years ago and the girls lirst donned their
suits, the presence of a man within a ra
dius of three blocks wrought the most
awful consternation. Now men pass back
and forth throuch the r-vm to and from
the laboratory during the girls" cla.-aes and
ni'liing is thought ot it. Before long :hi

frage in ainietirs is one oi me cnarms of

must get a basket ball guide beforehand and

the day. It may not be a great while. Judg-

	<text>NEW RULES ON BASKETBALL
Changed Conditions For Championship
Contests.
Up to the present the basketball
rules have been amended each season
by additions and omissions in various
places. This year, however, the rules
have been rearranged and many rules
bear different numbers and are not
found in the same successive order.
An advantage in the new rule book
also is that at the top of the page i3
the page, so that it is no longer neccs-
indicated the rule number printed on
that page, so that it is no longer ne
cessary to turn back or forth to ascer
tain which rule is being read.
The first new feature is that the
rules became effective Nov. 1, 1904.
This settled a fixed time for everywhere
and did not leave it open for teams to
play old Ule3 because "they did not
have the new book and there is noth
ing in the rules saying when they be
come effective," In referring to the
basket, the word "basket" is not used
in contradiction to "goal."
The minimum size of playing space
(2,400 square feet) is omitted in rule 1.
section 1. Rule 3, section 1, requires
a background of wood at least three
quarters of an inch thick for the bas
kets. Screens are no longer permitted.
The paying of the officials expenses in
serial championship games is no longer
mandatory.
An important change in rule 11, sec
tion 10. prohibits more than one player
of each team from tackling the ball at
the same time. A "dribble" is now
only counted such when the player ad
vances more than two steps wtiile roll-

ing or bouncing the ball.
The rule that in a dribble both hands
shall not be used simultaneously more
than once is still effective. Under rule
11, section 17, a man is not out of
bounds if only one foot is outside.
Players may be changed at any time
during the game (new rule 1, section
26). Last year's rules as well as the
new rules authorizes the referee to
award one point to the man fouled by
an opponent while trying for goal.
There was some doubt formerly as to
whether the team whose player was
fouled should also have a free throw
for goal.
The uew rules add that "this shall
noi interfere with a free throw for goal
from foul line," thus making It pos
sible to secure four points on this olio
play, if while being fouled the player
throws the goal, two points are scored,
oue point is awarded by the nfere
aud the ilayer is allowed an additional
free throw for the foul giving him uu
opiiortunity of scoring one point moro
if he throws the foul goal.
Under the old rules if a player threw
for goal from outside and missed thu
basket the ball went to the center,
while under the new rules the ball con
tinues to play. r
Under rule 12, section 1 and 4. tho
referee is required to promptly dis
qualify any player using profane or
abusive language.</text>

Dr. Sharp e Takes Side of
Player at Intercollegiate
Meeting.
LEAVE OUT ROUGHNESS
Too Many Tecnnicsfities It Claim of
Coaches and Players New
Role Affects Centers.
New York, Nov. 29. Exception to the
trend of collegiate Icglsla ion was voiced
In no uncertain terms at the annual inter
pretation .neetlng of the Intercollegiate
basket-ball rules committee at the Hotel
Astor yesterday afternoon Dr. A. II.
Sharpe, coach of the Cornell football,
basket-ball, and baseball teams, took the
side cf the plajer and coach against the
rules committee, which, he said, was con
cerning itself more with ruling on tech
nicalities than on the practical issues of
the game.
The discussion arose when Dr. Joseph
E. Ray croft chairman of the rules com
mittee, and the presiding officer, called
for the consideration of Rule 11, which Is
designed to penalize blocking. The rule
had been amended over summer so that it
read: "A player is entitled to take any
position on the court but if in taking a
position he faces an opponent or makes
bodily contact with an opponent so as to
interfere with the latter's progress he
Is blocking."
Dr. Raycrott said that the change had
been made In the rule 'as part of the
general plan of the rulemakers to elim
inate all unnecessary roughness and com
pel the plajers to "play the ball and not
the man." By this rule, said Dr. Ray
croft all Illegal Interference with a play
er by his opponent resulting from the
close guarding of pla, would be deemed
a foul and penalized as such.
Dr. Sharpe carried his point because.
when the discussion had been concluded
and a vote taken on the Interpretation of
the rule Dr. It ay croft and Ralph Mor
gan, of the University of Pennsylvania,
secretary of the committee, agreed to
permit an editorial correction which sub
stituted an "and" for the "or" in the
rule in question, making it mean that
only by direct bodily contact can a player
block his opponent
The most important changes In the rules
forthe coming year have to do with the
"Jump" ball and the ball when It goes
out of bounds. In order to eliminate the
fouling that so frequently happened under
the old Jump rule, the players Jumping
for the ball now, either In the center or
on any part of the floor will have to
Jump with one hands behind the back.
The meeting ruled that b behind the
back was meant behind any part V the
back below the shoulder, with the hand
touchihg the back, rather than the strict
working of the section, which compelled
the player to have on hand behind the
back at the waistline.
The other rule regarding the Jump ball
was aimed to do away with a great many
of the "Jumps" along the sideline after
the ball has been out of bounds by giv
ing it to the opponent of the man last
touched by It The rules relating to
dribbling were also discussed, but no rul
ing was made.</text>

Fine Gyms Make Basketball Second Only To
Football In Popularity
BY EVERETT S. DEAN
Basketball ('each. Indiana l'.
Basketball is recognized in most
of the country as the second major
sport. Its progress has come about
solely on its merits. Proximity of
the crowd to the players lias made
it possible for the crowd to experi
ence thrills which go with speedy
action more than in any other
j sport.
Pine gymnasiums and field houses
in many states are real testimony
I to the popularity of basketball. De
mand for seating space has led
larger towns to build gymnasiums
With seating capacities of 4000 to
5000. F.ne field houses with seat
1 ing capacity from 8000 to 15.000
have been built to meet the college
demand. Outstanding basketball
plants of the country are the
I Palestra at the University of
Pennsylvania, and most of the field
houses of Big Ten schools. The
Indiana State High School Basket
ball Tournament is played each
i year before 20.000 fans and offers
a great spectacle to sportdom.
Schedule making and tournament
f play in high shools have been
regulated by state athletic asso
ciations to the extent that high
school basketball is on a sounder
basis than ever before. Schedules
once consisted of 35 games, which
were too many for the high school
boy. In some states 18 to 20 games
now make up the schedules. The
strain of long tournaments has
been avoided by spreading tourn
aments over a period of three weeks
j instead of two.

Basketball has gone through dif
ferent evolutionary stages and with
each succeeding one the game is
becoming more scientific.
Few people are aware of how
universally the game Is played.
During the last few' weeks I have
received requests for basketball
lessons from the following coun
tries: Alaska. Porto Rico. Mexico.
Guam, and France Our service
teams have no doubt been the
greatest medium of spreading the
game.

Basketball is played In the fol-
lowing countries that we know of:
Alaska, Canadian Provinces, Hawaii.1
China. Japan. Porto Rico and oth
er South American countries, Cuba.
Panama. San Salvador. Spain.
Greece, Persia. Guam. England, j
France, Mexico and others.
In many of these countries the
game is played outside due mostly
to the warm climate. However,
playing facilities are increasing
with the popularity of the games
as manifested by an order received
from the Mexican government bv
the Nurre Plate Glass Company of
Bloomington. Ind., for four com
plete sets of glass bank boards.
Mexico sent a team to tour the
mid-west last year and it surprised
everyone with its ability.</text>

My FRED BODEKER
The remarkable popularity of bas
ketball during the past 10 years has
elevated the game to the position of
one of the foremast in American sports.
The past decade has witnessed a seem
ingly impossible growth In the basket
game and even experts are puzzled over
the problem.
Basketball has proven itself to be
one of the best sports in every way
that help the American people to
amuse themselvefe in,the gymnasium.
Basketball makes no uncertain de
mands on heart and lungs and on en
durance generally. Basketball is a
game. That’s all—only a game. It is
not a combat nor a battle nor a fight*
as some people would term it. It is
just a game.
Authorities have often repeated the
statement that basketball does more
to form a man's character than any
other sport. The period of adolescence
is the time when basketball and sim
ilar games are played and when life’s
habits are formed and the character
largely determined. Politics is a game
and so is almost any business, and the
people are merely players in the game.
And so is basketball—it is a game and
one of the best.
DEVELOPS THE BODY
Basketball develops many parts of
the human body. It develops alertness,
gelt-control, skill, speed and brings ev
ery part of the body into action. The
game arouses the interest and enthu
siasm of every spectator. The simplic
ity and small quantity of apparatus
required, together with other chief
qualifications of the game, make it
one of the most valuable of our com
petitive games.
Basketball belongs to the large fam-
ily of games originated to amuse the
American public. It was first started
in 1891. Dr. James A. Naismtth, now
a member of the collegiate basketball
rules committee, was an instructor at
the Springfield Y. M. C. A. Training
school and undertook to devise an in
door game which would develop man
kind. Basketball was at first very sim
ple. Since then, however, the game has
undergone complete revision; but bas
ketball lovers all over the nation owe
to Dr. Naismith the honor of “invent
ing’’ the game.
Since 1891 basketball has made mar
velous strides. The game was adopted
by colleges, high schools, athletic as
sociations in all parts of the country.
The big eastern colleges first fell in
line and soon the movement spread to
the south. Beading southern colleges
and institutions quickly adopted the
game and by 1900 basketball was a
game that was beginning to be played
by all important institutions.
GROWTH IN 1906
In 1906 the game began to grow even
more popular. Athletic clubs in all parts
of the south were producing teams and
tights were being staged for the
•'championships.” Not only in the south
was the game popular, but the middle
west and the eastern states were far
ahead. It Is roughly estimated that
something over an average of 60 teams
were being produced in every state in
the union or over 2400 teams were
playing organized basketball to say
nothing of the innumerable grammar
schools and independent teams that
numbered as many more.
But basketball did not stop its won
derful growth. The game has some un
seen power that attracted clubs, col
leges and schools to adopt it. As the
years passed the number playing the
game increased and by 1910 the num
ber playing in 1906. which was es
timated to have been over 240°, was
estimated to have been doubled, or
nearly 3000 teams. This does not
elude independent teams but omy
teams as high schools, athletic clubs,
colleges and other educational institu
tion
Dr. Joseph E. Raycroft. chairman of
he joint committee on basketball
ules. is quoted as saying that the
umber of teams playing basketball
I 1910 was over 7000. This, however,
considered by many to be too large,
onsidering that six men 5s ine aver
ge number of players on one team,
ver 42,000 men were playing in or
anlzed basketball in 1910.
In Alabama in 1906, the number of
tarns playing basketball was something
he 10 or less, which Included the Bir
slngham Athletic club, Birmingham
Ugh school, Mobile, Montgomery, and a
ew others. The effects of the growth
ver the nation took effect in Alabama
nd the number in 1910 jumped to nearly
3 teams. A few hight schools were
laying the game, being seriously handt
apped by the lack of an Indoor court,
phile almost every athletic club and
M. C. A. in the state was represented
y a team.
OVER 100 TEAMS
In 1*16, the beginning of the present
eason, which Is about to come to a very
uccessful close, the number playing in
his state Jumped to over 100. Over 60
igh schools are playing basketball, with
ImoBt 40 athletic clubs and other instl
utions of this kind. The game is played
y every grammar school In the larger
itles of the state, while countless teams,
.norganlzed as in the Y. M. C. A., and
lass teams of various educational ln
tltutions, are following the same exam
Not only in Alabama but in all parts
>t the country Is the game making
apld strides toward the top of the lad
ler as an indoor sport. The number
paying In the United States at the
n-esent is estimated to go over 23,000
earns, which means that about 156,600
leople are playing organized basketball
X this number Alabama can boast of
Jmoat 700 players, which, although be
nw a majority of the statee, is well in
he advanced list.
Add so it can be seen, Alabama with
ractically every other state in the' union
fast taking to basketball, and expert
rltlcs who have watched Its growth for

the highest individual point scorer in
last night's game, with 24 points to
his credit, though Williams with 20

	<text>How the Young People of New York
ltclux Strict Formality at
Badminton*
The Way in Which n Howlinjj swell
Getsilimsell Ip for the Ilariu
less Game.
New York Letter: 1 have read a heap
within a month in the society columns ot
our city dailies and weeklies, as well as in
out-of-town letters, concerning one Noa
Don. who seems to be accepted as the
spring-tide belle of Fifth avenue. Non
sense! This is too big a town, and even the
limits of the most pretentious society are
too spacious, to permit any single girl to
pet unquestioned supremacy. I have seen
this precious creature, moreover, and 1 am
telling you Cor keeps that she is no such
thing as the accounts make her out. I'm
not denying her all the wit at repartee to
iredited to her. She truly has touguc as
iliarp and quick as ever 1 heard: but what
I am impressing on you this minute- is that
a Queen of Swelldom, if we ever do crown
one. will be perfection as to dress.
Now. Noa Don is merely a traveled
and educated gill, who has been round the
world to pick up conceits that startle and
amuse us; who has come into New York
with family connections that give her en
trance to the charmed circles of wealth, and
«he makes her witty comments— as
nave been so extensively reported with
considerable cleverness; but when 1 have
described her as she presented herself at
the Academy of Music the other evening
yon will understand why I won't concede
that she ought to be elevated into public
view as supremely fine. She ought to huve
been arrayed in fashionable evening
costume, of course, because she sat in a box
along with women so dressed. But she ap
parently aimed to be
DISTISCTIVKLY ODD.
Her hair was loose and fluffy, and the
only ornamentation or attempt at coiifure
was a curious Bori of gilded thing not un
like a crown -set on the top of her head.
Her dress was pale amber >atm, and its cut
was not unlike that of the current morning
gown. Her anus wene completely covered
by sleeves and gloves, but her nmiapn was
law 111 a Bquariah shape, outlined by a
Btand-up frill of lace, as little in the fashion
cf Queen Elizabeth. No. no; Noa Don
can not be officially admired, no matter
how smart her sayings, until she robes her
self in accordance with strict fashiou's
rules.
What a jolly row Miss Cleveland has
been kicking up. by the way. about low
corsages. Still, she is awfully right in con
demning some of the nudity, and
you will remember that 1 have been
doing the same missionary sort of
work for several seasons. i*he makes
n special point of it that the line of bareness
shall bo high enough bo cover all of the dis
tinct feminity. He* Idea is that bare amis,
an. l so much Of the breast as happens to be
flat, are not an immodest exposure: but as I
looked up from the perusal of her letter— it
was just before Starting tor B recent ion. and
a bevy of tirls were randy to go— and my
eyes fell on a maiden of exceeding meager
nests in curvatures, I said to myself:
'•Where would the line be dra*vn across
that creature if it were lowered in obedience
to .Miss Cleveland's proposition?''
BOUBKHOLO AIM l( I.LS
are so frequently asked about by a*ycor
respondents that I here give, by general
way of answer, a number of points. Pil
low-shams arc used in preference to fancy
trimmed slip overs. Lace curtains never
go out of fashion. They I.re used for
parlors, reception and dlning-rooma,
bedrooms, and. in fact, for all the
rooms of a houso. if preferred to the many
novelties in what is called .Madras lace.
really a muslin brocbe curtain, in various
colors to suit the furnitures of the room for
which they are intended. The moat htfh*
[onablc watch chain worn is a short fob
chain, with a ball at the end. which inavbe
plain, chased or set with Jewels. We did
not know that they were called Queen
Anne watch-chains, but that is probably
the name by which they arc known to some
fashion writers and to jewelers. Grena
dines are BOperceded by canvas or etamine
fabrics nowadays, but are still worn by a
few conservative ladies. Great variety in
form and color of upholstery, draperies and
all the pieces of furniture in a room is per
mitted by fashion at present. In fact, what
is called by some writers the eloctric room
that is. a room furnished with choice
furniture representing various modern or
medieval periods of art furnishings, and
harmoniously combining several subdued
colors with one prevailing tint or tone is
considered the height of taste. But it re
quires
OHKA.T JUDGMENT
in selecting the pieces of furniture, the cur
tains, carpets, decorations and ornaments
of such a room. There is danger of mak
ing it look like a furniture dealer's collec
tion. The rage for decorated china, or
delft, is on the wane, but when plain white
is used it is selected of the finest ware, and
is sometimes made decorative in the fluting
or waving of the pieces in dotting, scallop
hie. denting or flagreting the edges, the
handles and borders of the cups, dishes,
sauces, plates and side pieces. The most
exquisite and fanciful shapes of antique,
niediseval and modern pottery are chosen,
all done in white. Then, if color is de
manded on the table, it is supplied by flow
ers, all one color if possible, by fancy col
ored glass and open drawn work lines in
the tablecloth, showing the bright color
of the fine flannel cloth placed under
the white one. Sometime a long mat
of velvet or plush of the color of the
flowers and glass on the table is placed
down the center of the same, and on this
are placed the eperjoie, a central glass etna
for tlowers and lruit, and the little bisque.
j tiuures holding btekete t;dl of bon-bons,

a critical view at a net which extended

dressing- rooms, and presently emerged in
all the glory ol white llaunel knickerbock-
ers and shirt, with long red stockings, a
blue nnd white silk Norfolk jacket, and a
blue worsted Tarn O'Shanter cap perched
artfully upon his rather peculiar-looking
head. Around one of his slim wrists there
was a broad leather band clasped with four
buckles a scheme by which champion
badminton aud tennis players strengthen
wrists that have been strained by overplay.
The single glass now hung over his breast.
He danced about fora moment to limber up
his legs, and then, stepping out in the iu
closure across which the net was placed,
he slipped oflE his little cube into which was inserted a rim
of feathers and tossed it in the air. When
it came diving downward, with bullet-like

ward the roof. With the rich colors of his
costume and his nimbleness he might have
been tnistaden by a buloonist peering from
above for a huge tropical bird of some cay
but gawky sort disporting itself grotesquely
in the sun.
THE SOLITARY
young; badminton player who was romping
so joyously was a howling swell of a very
high order. He didn't look like a man of
pint importance, but socially his position 1
is enviable. A man who at the age of j
twenty-eiirht can boast of membership in
the Summerset club, of Boston; the Savage
club, of London; the Jockey club of Paris,
and the Union. Knickerbocker and Union

gave a yell of meeting that was quite un

street Arab.
••Late again. Miss Agatha," he chirped,
happily. "Ton me soul it is quite heart
rending for a man of my conscientiousness
and t lustful nature to receive these disap
pointments every play-day."
''Indeed, you are a paragon,"' said the
jrirl. smiling brightly, and aoastaglsßf wraps

Ibis morning. She was desperately blue
when she irot out of bed, and so she climbed
bark in again. Then she insisted upon my
rending to her until she felt more composed,
and there you are."
She had scarcely finished speaking when
there was a great chatter and bustle about,
and half a dozen people hurried in. Two
of the guls were in full tennis rig. and
when one of the men slipped off his long
ulster he revealed the fact that he. too. had
put on his play-day togs before suiting
from home.
WHAT STRUCK ME HARDEST.
However, was the fact that the belles
were so much more shapely and graceful
than the beaux. More than one bony fellow
had on what 1 believe actors call "Mats."
That is to Kay, their legs were artificially
enlarged and straightened by padding. No

One when costuming for badminton or ten
nis. The fashion is to wear soft woolen
skirts retelling to the ankles, and presuma
bly with no petticoats underneath. The in
tention is to leave the legs clear for the ex
ercise—also distinctly outlined as part of
the mend symmetry that constitutes so
much of the pleasant sightliness of the
■port. Well, every player of good sense
puts on exactly as many flannel skirts as
will produce the desired bulk. No speota
toi can tell whether there be one or six lay
ers of the soft fabric; but anyhow he never
sees the protuberance of a knee-pan or the
sharpness of a shinboue. Clara Belle in

	<text>A GAME FOR ALL SEASONS.
It Is Called "liadiulnton" ud Cuuie From
England.
Badminton was invented, or origin
ated, whichever you please, in England,
but owes its present rules to the Ah
medabad Badminton club of India,
Which has practically revived the sport.
It is a modification of lawn tennis, with
some important differences, as will be
seen further on, and has the advantage
that it can be, and generally is, played
in-doors. This make3 it both a suramet
and winter game.
Tho dimensions of the court must be
decided in a great measure by the capa
bilities of the room in which the game
is played. Tho best size Is one twenty
eight feet long by twenty feet broad.
The courts should bo marked off by
means of pegs and strings, or better,
when possible, by white chalk lines oe
the floor, and divided in the following
way: At each end ol the ground are
two courts, ten feet square, while the
center is formed by a piece of neutral
ground eight feet broad by twenty feet
long. On each of these outer lines of
the neutral ground and in the center
are placed tho posts which support tho
net The net, which is two feet to two
feet six inches deep, is suspended at a
height of six feet from the ground, and
firmly held by guy ropes attached to
posts.
The racquets used in Badminton, to
be easily and quickly Wielded, should
be lighter than those used in lawn ten
nis, and consequently smaller. A shut
tlecock is used instead of a ball, and
may be large or small, according to tho
wish of the players.
In its general line, Badminton is a
game played in the same fashion as
lawn tennis, with tho exception that
from one to four persons may play on a
side, and that tho shuttlecock must be
returned on the volley. Tho shuttle
cock is served and returned under tho
same provisions, except that, of course,
if the shuttlecock falls on the ground,
it Is counted as a miss to the player
missing it, and to his side. The servico
shall be from the "service-corner," tho
server and receiver each standing with
both feet within their respective quad
rants until the shuttlecock is struck.
The divisions of the respective courts
are only observed in the serve or first
hit; after that, the partners may stand
where they please, on their side of tha
net The shuttlecock must be served
in such a way that it falls clear over the
net, without touching the net, ropes or
posts, and falls inside the lines of the
service-court If the net Is touched in
service and tho shuttlecock falls over,
the stroke is considered as a "let," and
does not count as a fault against the
person serving. In play, however, the
touching of the net by the shuttlecock,
when it falls over, is counted as good
stroke. If the net is touched by the
racquets of the players, or if they reach
over the net with their racquets, tho
stroke counts against them. Two faults
puts "hand out" In all cases a shuttle
Cock falling on any of the boundary
lines Is regarded as a fault, as if it had
fallen outside Of the boundary lines,
both in service and play.
Iifteen points constitute the game.
In service no overhand stroke is allow
ed. The shuttlecock is judged by where
it strikes and not by where it lies after
striking. In judging whether a player
has reached over tho net, the umpire
should bo careful to note if the shuttle
cock Is struck before it has crossed the
net and not by the racquet of the play
or, which is naturally carried forward
by the impetus of the stroke and which
might arrive at a slight angle over the
net, although the shuttlecock itself was
struck on the correct side. If, however,
the net is touched by the racquet the
stroke counts against the player, wheth
er the shuttlecock was struck on the
right side of the net or not
As will be seen from the description,
Badminton requires agility and a quick
eye, rather than great strength, and it
will be found to be a game at which
girls can play with pleasure and profit

badminton Has Not Driven
Tennis From Favor.
BOSSIP OF THE CHAMPIONS.
I y Mabel Cahill, the John L. Sullivan
•f the Xew York Club, and Other
i Great Flayers.
1
i jriw YORK. May 25.—[Special Corre
jpoodence.J—The tennis season of 1891 has
fairly begun, and from present appear
ances it will be the liveliest one that has
aver been known in this country. There
was a prospect earlier in the season that
badminton might supplant the older game
in favor, but every one concerned now
scouts the possibility of such a result. No
one, naturally, takes a keener interest in
the question than the makers of tennis
goods, and they report the largest advance
tale* on record. It is one of the not to be
forgotten consequences of the popularity
of lawn tennis that the manufacture and
nleof neta, rackets, lawn markers, shoes
and uniforms has become a great industry.
It is only a few years since all these goods
were imported from England, the home of
fee game; now they are practically all
Bade here, and th» business amounts to
something like $10,000,000 a year to the
trade. This is looking at the other side of
the sport, but the point of view is not an
unimportant one.
The clubs in and about New York are in
nnmfctr almost legion, and they are pre
paring busily for championship events,
mcticaliy the season begins with Decora
tion day, the month of fine weather before
that date being given np to practice play
ing. Of course, play begins earlier South.
The Washington City tournament for the
championship of the Southern states was
held in the middle of May. Tomorrow
the New York Tennis Club will hold its
spring games, and from now to the end of
the season in October there will be a
tournament every day—for not a summer
hotel of any size is without its tennis
courts, the smaJlest villages have their
clubs, and matches and return matches
t are shrewdly relied upon to keep up the
interest in the game.
Undoubtedly the success of tennis is
OLLIE CA MPBELL.
largely due to the fact that men and
women can play it together. For flirta
tion purposes it may not quite eoual the
sedate and sluggish game of croquet,
but for a judicious combination of
sport and opportunities for tete-a-tetes
its equal has never been invented.
Indeed, tennis is the ideal ladies' game.
As it requires agility rather than strength
to play tennis, there is no reason why
women should not play quite as well as
men, if it were not for the perpetual haudi
cap ot skirts. As it is, an active young
woman is about a match for a stout and
middle-aped man, with equal practice, and
some of the l>est women players can hold
their own with any but the very best men.
i his is a test not to be recommended,how
ever, as the practice of playing with one of
the other sex rather tends to break a man
up. as he is divided between his gallantry
and his desire to excel. Thus it may easily
happen that a man will show tip in better
form at the end of a season with compara
tively little practice with men than if he
had considerable careless playing with
women. Championship games are, of
course, always between players of the
•tne sex.

fi.>rdinary tennis player, met with a dis

"Ollie" Campbell, the present
bolder ot the championship, both having
park in past years,
though Mr. Slocum is ;IOR a member of
P:. George's Club, of New York. There is
perhaps no place in the country where bet
ter provision is made for tennis playing on
large scale than at Prospect park, and
there are few days in spring or summer
when a considerable number of games are
lot going on there simultaneously.

Miss Robinson, of Staten Island,
Mrs Morgan, of Short Hill*. N. J.,
the Misses Kiting. Frazer and Temple, of
Westchester county, and Miss Colby, of
Orange, N. J., are among the famous play
ers who may contert for the honors with
Miss< ah:i! and the Roosevelt sisters. Of
course, there will be dark horses, too, who
at the last moment mav appear to wrest
the leadership away from the well-known
plavers. It is always more difficult to
predict women's piaying than men's.
They have more time for practice, they
are quite as numerous, if not more so. and
they are far less likely to enter champion
ship contests than men, even if quite pro
ficient. Thus local pride may almost at
any time force to the front some splendid
player before unheard of outside of her
county. It is the peculiarity of the plav
ers of both sexes that they are at their
best while quite young and do jiotlong
retain their supremacy.
Badminton came to the front last winter
as an indoors game, for which it was well
adapted by the smallness of the court re
quired. A tennis court is 78 feet by 27
wider than an ordinary city lot and nearly
as deep. The badminton court is only 44
feet by 20, and can be recommended for a
home game where spare is verv limited.
The net is shorter and higher. The short
service line is 6 feet 6 inches from the net.
The base line is 15 feet t> inches farther
back on either side. The net itself is 16
feet long and 5 feet high in the middle.
In the play a shuttlecock is used in
stead of the white ball used in ten
nis. This is made of rubber and
feathered to steady its (light. Ordinary
tennis rackets are used instead of the ola
faehioned "battledores." The game is, in
fact, a sort of cross between lawn tennis
and the older game, and is said to be the
invention of an English officer in India,
who found the climate too hot for ten
nis. Perhaps that is the reason why old
tennis players call badminton a lazy peo-
Sle's When such sturdy at hletes as
[amihon Cary and .Stanley Mortimer and
such clever tennis experts as Miss Annie
Webb, Miss Turnure, Miss Minturn and
Miss Elsie Mitchell play and enjoy thgame, however, it can safely he assumed
that, there is plenty of exercise in it.
The rules of badminton are so simple
that they can be summarized in a para
graph. There is no authoritative Ameri
can body like the National Tennis Associ
ation, but the English rules are used:
The sides toss for choiceof ends or service
before the first game of a match, and change
to the other sideof the netafter each game.
The single-handed and double-handed
game consists of fifteen ares. At "13 all,"
the side which first reaches thirteen has
the option of "setting^'five; at 14 all, of
setting three. In three-handed or four-
handed jrames the game consists of twenty
one aces. First set is at 19 all; second at
20 all. A fault made by a player whose
I side is in puts a baud out; if made by a
j player whose side is out it counts an afe to
i the in side. It is a fault if the service is
I "overhand"; if the rirs-t part of the path of
the shuttlecock is inclined downward ;if the
service falls into the wrong court; if the ser
vice falls short of the service line or outside
the bounding line; unless both the server's
teet are in his own court; if the shuttle
cock falls outside the bounds of the court;
if the shuttlecock does not pass between
the posts, or if it pass under or through
tiie net or touch anything except the bat
of the striker, or the top of the net if the
shuttlecock !>e hit twice intentionally by
tiie same player; if the shuttlecock be
struck before it crosses the striker's side of
i the net; if the striker touch the net or its
supports with his racket or otherwise,
i The player in the right-hand court com
mencea the game by serving to the plaver
in the adverse right-hand oourt; if tfiat
leaver return the shuttlecock, it must be
hit ack by the in side and then returned
by the out side till a fault is made by one
j side or the other. The game is continued
in this manner, count being chanced after
j each ace ;s made. The service lines nre
disregarded alter the serve is returned,
j Iho innings always begin with the player
j in the right-hand court, and serves arc
i made alternately from each court into the
one d. t.; iia.lv opposite. In two. three
and tour-handed games, the side begin
ning a game has only one hand in its nrst
innings if there are two a side, and only
two hands if there are three a side. Inatwo
h and el game only the ptrson served to may
take a serve; not so in a three or four
handed game. The service must not begin
till the opponent is ready, but any attempt
to return is taken to indicate readiness.
Any unforseen or accidental hindrance
may be given by a "let" bv the umpire on
appeal from either side "before the next
service commences or before the players
have changed sides at the end of a game.
A "let" cannot be claimed it" an attempt
I ha* been made to strike the shuttlecock
Pitiably the next winter there will be a
badminton association iu this country r or
the new game may he taken under the

|J Ij inatcd, whichever you please, in

RtjlSSSfj to the Ahmedabad Badminton Club,
Mvlfilr" o f India, which has practically re
vived the sport. It is a modification
of lawn tennis, with some important differ
ences, as will be seen further on, and has the
advantage that it can be,- and generally is,
played indoors. This makes it both a sum
mer and winter game.
The dimensions of the court Imuit be de
cided in a grjfat measure by the j capabilities
of the room in, which the game lis played.
The best size ii one 28 feet long- by 20 feet
broad. The courts should be marked off by
means of pegs and strings, 'or better, when,
possible, by white chalk lines jon j the floor,
and divided in the following way: At each
end of the ground axe two courts. L jlO feet
square, while the centre is formed by a piece
of neutral ground 8 feet broad by 20 feet long.
On each of the outer lines of the neutral
I ground and in the centre are placed the posts
which support the net. .C-
The net, which is 2 feet to 2l2 l feet 6 inches
deep, is suspended at a height of 6 feet from
the ground, and firmly held by. guy ropes at
i tached to posts. ,y L
1 The racquets used in Badminton, to be easily
and quickly wielded, should be lighter than
those used in lawn tennis, and consequently
smaller. A shuttlecock is used instead of a
ball, and may be large or small, accorum" to
the 'wish of the players. .7 .1
In its general; line, Badminton is a game
played in the same fashion': as lawn tenni*,
with the exception that from one to four
persons may play on a side, and that the shut
tlecock must be returned on the volley. -_•
The shuttlecock is served and returned
under the same provisions, except that, of
i course if the shuttlecock falls on the ground,
it is counted as a miss to. the player missing
it and to his side." The service shall be from
the "service-corner," the server I and receiver
each standing with both feet within their
respective quadrants until the shuttlecock v
struck.
The divisions of the respective courts are
only observed in the serve or first hit; after
that the partners may 1 stand where they
please, on their side of the ¦net....
The shuttlecock must be served in Mich a
wav that it falls clear over the net. without
touching the net, ropes or posts, and falls in
ide the lines of the service court.
If the net is touched m service and the
shuttlecock falls over, the stroke is oonsid

At tltc first tfelfOi 'crawAe&6>r J fyr/ff£ Jttf/a /}&3&7ered 38 a "let," and does not count us a fault
against tbe person serving.
In play, however, the touching of the net
by the shuttlecock, when it falls over, is
counted as good stroke.
If the net is touched by the racquets of the
players, or if they reach over the ne£_ with
their racquets, the stroke counts against
them.
Two faultf puts "hand out." In all cases
a shuttlecock falling on any of the boundary
lines is regarded as a fault, as if it had fallen
outside of the boundary lines, both in service
and play.
Fifteen points constitute the game. In ser
vice no overhand stroke is allowed.
The shuttlecock is judged by where it strikes
and not by where it lies after striking.
In judging whether a player has reached
ever the net, the umpire should be careful to
note if the shuttlecock is struck before it
has crossed the net and not by the racquet of
the player, which is naturally carried forward
by the impetus of the stroke and which might
arrive at a slight angle over the net. although
the -shuttlecock itself was struck fairly on the
correct side.
If, however, the net is touched by the
racquet the stroke counts against the player,
whether the shuttlecock was struck on the
right side of the net or not.
As will be st%n from the description, Bad
minton requires agility and a quick eye, rather
than great strength, and it will be found to
be a game at which girls can play with pleas

	<text>Badminton Threatens
Ping Pong’s VoQiie j
Badminton Is coming Into vogue again
In a way that promises to lay ping pong
on the shelf as a society game. English
social lights, which took so devotedly to
ping pong have begun to serve notice that
Badminton is in better taste, and a so
cial organ says of the game, “Badminton
can be played out of doors, on a lawn or
on a carriage drive, or indoors in a
large room. Two, three, four, six or
eight may play at once. The best game,
however, is six, when there are two wom
en up at each side of the net while a
man keeps back behind them. The game, j
as might be expected, derived its name
from the fact that it was first introduced j
in England by a member of a house par- j
ty at Badminton in the time of the late I
Duke of Beaufort.
Sober tennis players who had scorned
ping pong as something immeasurably
less than tennis may incline toward Bad
minton, though it, too, may be reduced
to indoor quarters. For. with the excep
tion of the balls used. Badminton is ten
nis. its plays and scores being observed
according to the same rules, and only
the lack of the rebounding quality in the
bails differing from tennis.
The ball used is the shuttlecock that
goes with the game of battledore. It is a
ball of cork, weighted with lead, or it
may be hard rubber, and in either case
it is winged with feathers, which causes
the ball to revolve, at the same time
flying swiftly, guided by the feather
wings. As the ball will not rebound when
striking the earth or floor, it must be
“volleyed," and each failure to return
the ball is counted against the player
who misses.
For playing Badminton the best court 1
is 28 feet long and 20 feet wide, with the; j
service line ten feet from the base line.
A net one foot deep is stretchd across
the court five and a half feet above the
ground.
Only in the fact that these hard balls j
are winged, do not rebound, and have to I
be “volleyed,” does the game differ from
tennis. In this volleying, however, is the
tension and strained interest for both
player and spectator, and as a rival for
ping pong it looks as if society needed
only to pass the word to effect the
change.</text>

that promises to be the most »uccewful
of the hind Montgomery has ever haa.
Will be on. The indication* arc that
there will bo a record breaWng crowd
for. aside from the fact that It is the
first of the league games the two teams,
the Falcons and Independents, are both
verv popular with a large following, both
making great reputations in the baseball
line last summer.
The patrons of the game will find
grounds, grand stand and bleachers n
as sehlpshape order as if professional nail
was being played. Yesterday a set of reg
ulation basts and a regulation rubber
borne plate were received. U
few people are aware of thefaettbat
the 190- home plate is responsible for the
phenomenal games being put up' W
pitchers in the different professional
leagues. The plate this season, instead
Iff being S'tuare is a kind of a triangle
and instead of a 12-inch front faring the
pin her It is 17 inches. I his gives the
pitcher five inches more play and he haa
all aorta of chances to cut the corners, a
great advantage to the man in the box
and a corresponding disadvantage to the
batter.
The street railway company yesterday
morning sent a big roller and mower out
to the grounds and President. Screws
had the infield thoroughly rolled and
packed and the grass in the outfield cu%
out. The street railway people are re
pairing the fences, wire-netting in the
grandstand and everything else that
needs repairs. They say that they will
have all the cars needed to take any kind
of crowd out to the games and bring
them home comfortably. A substantial
stand was being built yesterday for the
Infirmary Aid and will he ready by Sat
urday's game
One hour's hard practice a day has been
put in all this week by the Falcons and
Independents, and when they get on the
field Saturday both teams will be in the
pink of condition. After Saturday s game
the next league game will probably be
between the Gersts and Millers, the game
to be played for the benefit of the Confed
erate Soldiers' Home at Mountain Creek,
he President will be glad to heard from
ensacola. Columbus and any of the out
f-town teams.
The Memphis Commercial-Appeal has
the following:
Those who invested in the future pay
or play betting on the American Derby,
bai king Abo Frank. G. C. Bennett’s colt
to win that classic, had just as well make
up their minds to part with the amounts
they wagered. Abe Frank has raced in a
manner since leaving Memphis to cause
a majority of those who backed him at
long odds during the winter to abandon
inv idea of cashing their bets for the
American Derby. There are still a few.
however, that cling to the adage of
"where there is life there is hope.
A letter received here yesterday from
G. C .Bennett says that Abe Frank has
started in his last IVrhy. He will not be
imong the field that faces the starter
n the American Derby a week from next
Saturday, and he will never be sent after
mother Derby. Mr. Bennett draws the
line on Derbies now and will go after :i
ear-old stakes, which are not featured
is Derbies.
The determination of Bennett to keep
Abe Frank out of the American Derby
will cause much tearing of tickets It:

,(Mount «»f backing during the wintei
when Hi odds wore offered at 10 to 1
Mr. Bennett holds tickets aggregatinj
Jl.oOft. which are now nothing but sum
mcr souvenirs of the winter Americai
Derby favorite.
Two big races will be run Saturday. th<
Suburban Handicap it Sheepshead pa;
md the St. Louis Derby.
This ear's St. Louis Derby will b<
one of the m »"t valuable year-old stake
decided «>n the American turf this sea
sou with th®. exception of the Lawrenc
Realisation and the American Derby. The
Iaiwrenee Realisation, which is run at
Coney Island. *s worth about $30,000. while
the American Dert>y at Washington Park
has $20,000 added. The at. Louis Derby
will be worth about $15,000. This makes
It more valuable than either the Brook
lyn or Suburban handicaps. The 8t. Louis
Derby is a tjfie-honorcd classic with an
exceedingly Interesting history. It was
established in 1882. the year the present
Fair Grounds track was thrown open to
the public. B. C. Pate's Monogram won
the first St. Louis Derby, which was
worth $1,975 to the winner. In 1892 the
stake was abolished, but in 1896 was re
vived again under a different name, being
known as the National Derby. Prince
Lief won the stake in 1896. It had a
guaranteed value of $20,000 that year. In
1897 the stake was rechristened the St.
Louis Derby. It was worth $10,000 and
was captured by Ornament. John W.
Schorr has taken the last two Derbies,
with Sam Phillips in 1900 and Silverdale
in 1901. He will not have a starter this
year.
An Eastern tipster whose system is
"play the long shots.” advises against
the first choices by calling attention to
the downfall of favorites In 1901 and 1902
as follows:
In 1901:
Metropolitan. Starbright, 2 to 1. Lost.
Brooklyn Handicap. Banaster. 8 to 5,
Nit.
Suburban Handicap. Ethelbert, 7 to 6.
Trut.
Brighton Handicap, Alceds. 2 to 1,
Foozeled.
Futurity. Nasturtium. 2 to 1. No score.
Realization. Commando, 1 to 10. Got
the rinky-dink.
In 1902:
Carter Handicap, Himself, 7 to 5.
Dumped.
Metropolitan, Herbert. Down and out.
Withers. 0*4 Epgland. 2 to 1. Didn’t.
Belmont, Compute, 2 to 1. Flung high
and dry.
Jockey Club Stakes, Heno, 7 to 10.
Went wrong.
Brooklyn Handicap. Advance Guard, 2
to 1. Hard luck.
English Derby, Scepter, 7 to 2. Too
much touting.
Badminton is coming Into vogue again
in a way that promises to lay ping pong
on the shelf air a society game. English
social lights, which took so devotedly to
ping pong, have begun to serve notice
that Badminton is in better taste, and a
social organ says of the game: “Bad
minton can be played out of doors, on
a lawn or on a carriage drive, and in
doors in a large room. Two. three, four,
six or eight may play at once. The game,
however, is six. when there are two wo
men up at each side of the net while a
man keeps back behind them. The game,
as might be expected, derived its name
from the fart that it was first intro
duced in England by a member of a
house,.party at Badminton in the time
of the late Duke of Beaufort.”
Sober tennis players who have scorned
ping pong as sometimes immeasurably
less than tennis may incline towards
Badminton, though it. too, nay he re
duced to indoor quirters. For. with the
exception of the balls used. Badminton is
tennis. Its plays and scores being oh
served according to the same rules, an-1
only the lack of the rebounding quality
in the balls differing from tennis.
The ball used is the shuttlecock that
goes with the gamr of battledore. It is a
ball of cork, weighted with lead, or it
may he hard robber, and in either case it
is winged with feathers, which causes
the hall to revolve, at the same time
flying swiftly, guided by, th$ feather
wings. As the ball will not rebound when
striking the earth or floor, it must be
“volleyed.” and each failure to return
the ball is counted against the player
who misses.
Only in the fact that these hard halls
are winged, do not rebound, and have to
be "volleyed.” does the game dffTer from
tennis. Tn this volleying, however, is the
tension and strained interest for both
played and spectator, and as a rival for
ping pong it looks as 1f society needed
only to pass the word to effect the
change.</text>

Objective of the association
would be to promote and develop
the game, assist in the organiza
tion of clubs, conduct a state tour
nament and assist junior clubs and
school clubs.
There was a state badminton as

ly Morris Weiner
and a kid who was beginning to
show an aptitude with the tennis
racket. At that time, in tourna
ments in Philadalphia, those who
watched him closely were con
vinced that they saw symptoms of
excellence.
Last year, while still a junior
performer, this Pasadena young
ster returned to New York. On
that occasion there was no un
certainty about his high-geared
play at badminton. He had ironed
out the rough spots, profiting by
his knowledge that tennis had
yielded him in the National junior
championships at Culver, Indiana.
He won the junior title two years
ago and last year was succeeded
by his chief rival on the Pacific
Coast, Ted Shroeder.
No other American performer
with the tennis racket and bad
minton bat has ever scaled the
heights Freeman has attained. He
was a star of the first magnitude
in the national badminton cham
pionships in New York last year.
His blend of tennis and badmin
ton was smooth, according to the
experts, and in the recent shut
tlecock championship at Seattle
Freeman was the whole show, ta
king no fewer than three national
championships.
He is so strong at both games
that the Californian looms as the
overpowering force in any cham
pionship at either game. It is al
so interesting to observe that
Freeman trounced Hank Prusoff
at badminton in the latter’s home
town, thereby retaliating for the
defeat suffered at Forest Hills
last season at the hands of the
lad who went on to rate thirteenth
in the Nationals.
....By the way, the record books
also reveal that Davis Freeman is
the first Californian who has
achieved the highest honor in this
respect. He has made a record at
badminton which few can equal
and which only one other player
in the country has been able to
equal thus far. Freeman made
grand slam in singles and doubles.
The only player to do that hith
erto was Mrs. Del Barkhuff then
of Seattle and now of Honolulu,
who did the triple victory back in
1937, when this national event
was inaugurated in Chicago.
At a recent badminton tourna
ment, Dave was awarded the top
seeding, as champion, in singles,
He took that event with scarcely
any formidable opposition, suc
cesfully defending his crown as
there was no opponent capable of
taking him into camp.
And here you have the reasons
for it. He’s amazingly fast on
his feet, quick of anticipation and
durable for a long session. Speed,
stamina and sense three prere
quisites of the tennis player.
Freeman has made it evident
that he has what it takes in bad
minton and tennis to rate as a na
tional champion and to justify his
sponsor’s predictions that in him
we have a future Davis Cup play
er and what is more the first Jew
ish Davis Cup player in America.
Judge Hardy, former interna
tional Davis Cup team captain,
who is pushing Dave’s tennis as
pirations wrote in the U. S. Lawn
Tennis Journal only last month:
“Freeman has shown remark
able ability to round out his ten
nis stronkes. This makes him par
ticularly dangerous in the fore
court, repeatedly turning defen-</text>

	<text>Game Of Badminton
Takes Camp Davis
Personnel By Storm
Badminton, originated by British
army officers in India 98 years
ago, has taken Camp Davis by
storm. Scores of soldiers are play
ing the game every night in the
week, making use of the courts at
Farnsworth Hall.
The craze has gained such im
petus that it has been necessary
to move the bleachers in the sports
arena to make room for additional
courts.
The athletic office loans out
rackets and sells the birds, or shut,
tlecocks at cost to the players.
Similar to tennis, badminton is
played with lighter rackets and in
stead of a ball the shuttlecock is
used.
The shuttlecock is made of feath
ers inserted and cemented in a
half sphere of cork. Object of the
game is to keep the “bird” in
the air. Nets, higher than those
used in tennis, are strung across
the badminton courts.
Among the officers of Camp Da
vis who can be classed (more or
less) as experts at badminton are
Major J. B. Yost; Lieut. R. F.
Bailey, and Lieut H. A. Johnson.</text>

	<text>Labor's Holiday.
The first observance in tho state of
Minnesota of the 7th of September as a
national labor holiday passed off success
fully. The celebration was intended not
only to secure a day of recreation and rest.
but as an assertion of the growing intention
of the producer to secure recognition.
Other days In the year are set apart to
memorialize certain historical events, and
when the call was issued on the part of the
Trades and Labor assemblies of the cities of
Minneapolis, St. Paul and Stillwater for
ttie workingmen to take this one day of the
year for themselves, as a dedication to the
cause of their advancement, very few were
found who did not acknowledge the justice
and right of the demand. The mayors of
both .St. Paul and Minneapolis issued proc
lamations approvlving the celebration, and
employers generally did not attempt any
opposition. About :;,000 people attended
t he
LABOB PICNIC
at White Beai lake. Of this number prob
ably 1,500 came from Minneapolis, 1,300
from St. Paul and 300 from Stillwater. An
address was made by Richard Griffith of
igo, general worthy foreman of the
Knights of Labor, supplemented by re
murks from Dr. Ames of Min
neapolis. A program of sports
was carried out. while dancing
and boating contributed to lill up a day of
pleasure. The trains arrived from the
three cities at the lake about 11 o'clock in
the morning and the excursionists first
gathered in the pavilion at Cottage Park,
the Metropolitan band of St. Paul
discoursed music very acceptably. After
calling the meeting to order J. P. Mc-
Gaughey of Minneapolis, the president
of the day, introduced Richard
Griffith of Chicago, who had
been secured to make the address.
As the applause which greeted him died
away. Mr. Griffith stepped forward, and
after returning thanks lor the cordial greet
ing took up his theme, which might be
characterized as the
BENEFITS OP OKOA3TIZATIOX.
lie reviewed the history of the Knights
of Labor, going back to the time when ii was
a secret order. It was then denounced by
both press and pulpit, which did not under
stand its true nature. Being oath bound,
its members were prevented from replying
and were forced quietly to submit to mis
representation and imposition. The Knights
struggled on until 1880, when the general
assembly met at Detroit, Mich., and made
public the name and objects of the organiza
tion. Since then the march has been on
mard and upward, and the last assembly
organized m Chicago two weeks ago was
No. 4109.
The speaker then went on to illustrate
the difference between Trades unions and
the Knights of Labor. The unions are ex
clusive and take care only of themselves.
When a strike occurs in one trade, the
others simply look on and render no assist
ance, showing that
'•Tho weil-fcdpig 1 in the sty doth lip.
Regarding not tho cry of the hungry one that
passetli by."
The Knights of Labor are broader in their
humanity and regard an injury to one as
the concern of all. It receives into its fold
all who work for an honest living, no mat
ter whether he may be a street scraper or a
skilled mechanic. All stand on an equal
basis and only the non-providers—the bank
ers, lawyers, saloonkeepers and gamblers
are refused admittance.
To illustrate the efficacy of standing by
one another, as advocated by the Knights of
Labor, the speaker cited the great strike at
Pittsburg. The Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers was an exclusive organization.
When they struck the railroad company
simply tilled their places with firemen,
those of the Bremen with brakemen, and the
brakemen with yardmen. If the Locomo
tive Engineers, instead of being an exclus
ive union, had been an assembly of the
Knights of Labor, the other trades would
have stood by them and the railroad com
pany could not have filled their places.
The Knights of Labor are, however,
OPPOSED TO STRIKES
and court the settlement of differences by
arbitration. It opposes convict labor and is
doing the utmost to accomplish its abolition.
The effect of convict labor throughout the
whole United States is not strongly felt.
perhaps, but it affects localities disastrously
to the workingmen. For instance, Chicago
is tiie market for the boots and shoes
manufactured in eight penitentiaries.
No wonder many of the shoemakers of that
city are idle!
The Knights of Labor are also opposed
to child labor. In this connection n picture
was drawn of how the "store" and other
large mercantile establishments of Chicago
employ hundreds of little boys and girls at
wages ranging from Si to $1.50 per week.
These children should be in school, fitting
themselves for usefulness in life.
The Knights of Labor are also opposed
to the robbery of the public lands by specu
lators and the titled aristocrats who have
for 700 years deprived the people of the old
country of their lands and who now are
striving to steal the lands from the people
of the United States. Through the efforts
of the Knidit* of Labor the foreign con
tract system has been abolished, and the
stealing of public lands will also be pre
vented by the same means.
The Knights of Labor are opposed to the
discriminations of the law in favor of
CAPITAL AS AGAINST LABOR.
What this discrimination means? was
shown by the fact that in Chicago the fail
ure of savings brinks robbed So, 000 people
of their hard-earned savings, while the
bank presidents under the protection of the
law are allowed to retain and enjoy their
ill-gotten gams. The man who steals a loaf
of bread because Of starvation is also pro
tected by law—but is sent to prison.
"The law condemns the man or woman
Who steals the goose from off the common,
Bui lets tho greater felon lose,
Who steals the eoramna from thciroosc."
Mr. Griffiths then went on to describe a
pic. urc he had seen which portrayed the
workingman aa struggling to support the
aristocracy nnd non-producers, saying it
was time that labor should find or.t "why it
receives only 40 per cent, of the wealth it
produces. Why it has to pay for all the
show.
After picturing the misery and poverty
of the poor people, who live in the slums of
great cities. Mr. Grlfllihs closed by strongly
urging the advancement of harmony in the
ranks of labor, and expressed the hope that
Minnesota would be found tailing the lead
Ul every effort made to raise upon his feet
the down trodden son of toil. At the con
clusion of his remarks Mr. Griffiths was
heartily applauded. There were loud calls
for ex-Mayor Ames of Minneapolis, who
was present and that gentleman made a
brief address in response. He said he con
-1 himself workingman and was

Me believed In the organization of
labor and thought that only in this way
could recognition be secured. He advised
them to beware of the men who could be
hired to betray their cause, while the fullest
confidence should be laced in ffibse who
have given proof of their fidelity. He did
not care, he sr.id. to detain his hearers with
any extended remarks. They were all
there for fun and frolic and the shorter the
speeches the better.
The doctor's concluding hit was the signal
for a rush for dinner. Those who "had
brought lunch baskets gathered their friends j
about them, vhwo o:.iucs patronized the
very palatable lunch which had been j
furnished by the Ladies' Aid society of St.

NATIONAL LABOR DAY.
Congress Has Officially Bo cog
nized the Right of Our Toilers.
A Day Set Apart for Rest and Recreation
In the Interest of tho Laboring- Man
Some Stites Already I'rovld-
ed Tor by Statute.
Special Lcttcr.l
Ihc cause of labor received an im
portant recognition in one of the few
hills just passed by the present con
gress that making the first Monday
in September henceforth a national
holiday devoted to the cause of tho
toiler and set apart for a rest-day in
tho workingman's interest. Other
sentiments and classes arc already
jwell remembered in the year's calen
dar. There is patriotism in Fourth of
July celebrations, remembrance of vet
erans at Decoration day, acknowledg
ment of favors of Providence at Thanks
giving, gifts at Christmas, social duties
Dn New Year's and religious ceremo
nials at Easter. But there has never
been in American customs any recog
nition of tho laboring classes in gen
erally observed holidays.
The origin of Labor day dates back
to 1SS0, when following the labor diffi-
ex-gov. rrasiriniEr, of kansas.
cnlties of 1877 the cause of the labor
unions received a considerable im
petus. There was a demand for a
general gala occasion, and in the labor
assembly of New York the matter of
adopting a special day for this purpose
was discussed. No particular resnlt
was attained beside adopting the first
Monday in September as a day for
worklngmcn's relaxation.
With the recurrence of the season the
idea spread, and labor unions of all
lands came to select a day in the first
week of September for their celebra
tions of this kind, the custom spread
ing from the cities and manufacturing
towns to the country districts until it
was well nigh national in its extent.
Up to 1890, however, no state observ
ance of the day had taken plack. In
August of that year Gov. L. U. Hum
jphrey, of Kansas, by request of the
'Topcka trades assembly, issued a proc
lamation setting ;aside the first day of
September for a labor holiday and ask
ing the people of the commonwealth to
devote the occasion to tho interest of
the toilers. The proclamation was an
innovation, and Gov. Humphrey was
criticized by many for his action.
Time, however, demonstrated his good
judgment, for several other governors
speedily followed his example and
ttatc legislatures took action on tho
(subject until, before congress had na
tionalized the day, more than half tho
states already had labor days of their
own.
The bill adopted June 23 was advo
cated by Congressman Cummings, who
immediately after its passage by house
and senate took it himself to President
,Clevcland and witnessed its signature.
The bill was a long time on the cal
endar, but required only a short timo
for reading or discussion, for it is ex
ceedingly brief. It is as follows:
"I3c it enacted, etc.. That tho first Monday
in September in each year, being tho day cele
brated and known as Labors holiday, is hcrc
fcy made a lcpl public holiday, to all intents
cad purposes, in the same manner as Christ
inas, the 1st dav of January, tho 2d day of
February, tho 3Cth day of May and tho 4th
day of July arc cow made by law public holi
days." In one respect the law is a curious
one. for it is unusual for congress to
legislate on the subject of holidays ex
cept for the District of Columbia.
There are exceptions, but they are of
a special character. April 30, 18S9, the
centennial anniversary of the inaugura
tion of the first president was made a
national public holiday throughout
the United States by the act of March
2, 1SS9. The last congress also passed
a joint resolution authorizing the pres
ident to recommend October 1, 1S92,
the four hundredth anniversary of the
discovery of America, as "on- to be
observed by the people by public dem
onstrations, and suitable exercises in
the schools and other places. These
arc the only national holidays pro
vided for by congress outside of this
latest addition to the list. It is ob
jected by some that the putting of
the day en the plane of the others
mentioned in the act is misleading
since none of them is a. national holi
day in a technical sense. They are
mado holidays hy state law or by na
tional enactment limited in its appli
cation to the District of Coluuroia.
Zren Thanksgiving day, though desig- j
natcd by the president, becomes a pub
lic holiday only by state legislation
providing that any day designated by
president or governor as a day of
thanksgiving shall be a public holiday.
Some states, including Pennsylvania,
already have a Labor day of their own,
set apart by state legislation, and have
chosen the first Saturday in September
rather than -the first Monday as being
more suitable to the laboring classes
who get a holiday at the end of the
week s work rather than the beginning.
The question arises in such cases: Dave
these states now two Labor days or
shall the federal holiday take pre
cedence over that of the common
wealth? A change in the state laws
to conform with the new conditions
may be expected next winter in these
states.
The setting apart of a holiday for
labor celebrations is due perhaps more
to the Knights of Labor than any one
organization. The celebrations are
nearly always held under the auspices
of this body, although there is gen
erally a hearty cooperation on the part
of other societies of workingmen and
those interested in their cause. The
late head of the order, T. V. Powderly,
was its enthusiastic supporter for
years.
The Labor day observance is not
similar to that of any other holiday.
It approaches the Fourth of July, but
is without the hilarity and exuberance
of that occasion. There is an under
tone of seriousness that tells of tho
earnestness of the cause of the work
ingman and shows the importance of
his interests in the development of
American civilization.
The chief feature of the day is a
parade but it is not a procession de
voted to drum majors and bunting. It
is more in the nature of a trades' dis
ply in which every avocation is repre
sented by workmen busy at their va
rious trades. Then there is a big pic
nic dinner rand later the speeches,
which are a far more important por
tion of the progammc than in most
other holidays. In th addresses there
has often been a tendency to a radical
presentation of the cause of the work
men, and the occasion has sometimes
been taken advantage of by reckless
agitators who have seized tho opportu
nity to express un-American and un
patriotic ideas.
While it is perhaps true that some
what extreme ideas are more readily
received than upon occasions like In
dependence day it is not generally dono
without disapprobation, and with tho
day made a rest day for the whole na
tion instead of for a particular class or
section, its observance will become far
more broad and less marred by any ex
pression tending to arouse antagonism
between the toilers and any other class
whatever.
The significance of the day is far
reaching, and the unanimity with
which congress indorsed it. the bill
a Hi
GRAND MASTER WORKMAX SOVEREIGN.
passing practically without opposition
in cither branch of congress, proves the
sympathy with which it has been re
ceived by those high in authority.
Indications arc that it will be moro
generally observed this year than ever
before in the nation's history, and the
problems that confront labor and have
received so much discussion during the
past few months will be prominently
before the gatherings in every village,
city and hamlet in the nation for so
lution. It is an encouragiug sign that labor
has received this recognition, and that
the United States of America has been
the first nation on earth to make so
important a concession to the laboring
classes. It is not only a permanent
concession, for such an enactment can
never be abrogated, but it will, if
rightly used, aid in bringing about a
hotter understanding of the laborques
tion, now 60 prominent in political and
ethical economy the world over.</text>

	<text>LABOR WILL REST.
A Grand Parade of Six
Divisions.
GRIEVANCE OF THE UNIONS.
How the Labor Day Law Was
Blundered With.
THE LEADING AIEN OF THE FETE.
Exercises in Metropolitan Temple.
A Theatrical Performance in
Turn Verein Hall.
Labor day will be appropriately cele
brated to-day, in spite of the general mis
understanding as to whether or not it is a
legal holiday. The various labor unions
in San Francisco and Alameda County
will turn out for a grand parade, with
music and floats and banners and oratory.
Hut it will not be entirely satisfactory to
the labor unions as a whole, because only
a limited number of members will be per
mitted to participate. Stores, shops and
factories will be kept in operation pretty
much the same as if no national Labor day
exited in the statute-books of the United
States or of California. The members of
the various labor unions feel that they
have a grievance and a grudge against
some manipulator of legislative proceed
ings.
The bill which passed tbe California
Legislature, and became a law, desig
nating the first Monday in October of each
year as a legal holiday and "Labor
day," was introduced by the efforts of the
laboring men. In its original state it des
ignated the first Monday in September as
Labor's day, and it passed to engrossment
in that condition. But, through some
hocus pocus not explainable, the engrossed
bill changed th« time to tbe first Monday
in October, and in the rush of business it
was passed without tbe change being ob
served, and received the Governor's signa
ture. That is the grievance.
The San Francisco Labor Council sent a
communication on the subject to Governor
Markuam, asking if he would not ignore
the statute and issue a proclamation fix
ing Labor day on the first Monday ol
September. But this the Governor de
clined to do. In his reply, however, he
stated that if tbe labor unions throughout
the State desire to have the date changed
in conformity with the original bill, lie
will recommend such change to the next
Legislature.
How the change in tbe original Dill
came about no one seems to know. It may
have been a mere clerical error on the
part ot the engrossing clerk, or, for some
reason not clearly understood, it may have
been brought about intentionally. There
was at the lime the bill passed consider
able opposition to tbe measure, owing to
the closeness of Admission day, Septem
ber 9, to the proposed Labor day. and it is
suspected that tbe change was effected by
and through the influence of this opposi
tion. Last yenr tbe labor unions refused
1 to accept the first Monday in October as i
I labor's holiday, and, therefore, appropri
ated the corresponding Monday of Sep
tember the national day— and celebrated
to the best of their ability.
This year they will do the same, and the
autumn sun will shine upon a grand street
parade and the ocean winds will be stayed
in their course by the music of many
I instruments.
As many of the federated toilers in this
city and OaKland as can obtain leave of
absence irom their employers will attend
and participate in the celebration. Of
course the demonstration will not -be so
great as if it were in fact a legal holiday
by legal enactment. But it will be credi
table so far as it can go.
W. J. B. Mackay of the Sailors' Union
of tbe Pacific is the grana marshal of the
day. His chiefs of staff are: E. P. Bur
man ot the Furniture Workers' Union. L.
lluey of the Sailors' Union and H. lingers

tlemen, together with the appointed aids,

be supplied by an orchestra under, the
direction of Professor O. T. Schuppert.
A grand theatrical performance will be
given in Turn Verein Hall, on Turk street,
at 8 o'clock to-night.
It is believed by the members of the ar
rangement committee that a number of
wholesale stores will close, at least during
a portion of the day, in order to give their
employes an opportunity to attend the
celebration, even though it is nut a legal
Holiday. Tne banks will be open, but ex
pect a slack business during the day. All
the Government departments. Federal,
State, city aud county— except some of the
courts— ;uid the public schools will go on
as usual-
There was a final meeting r,f the grand
marshal and his aids, at 363 Jessie street,
last night, and all necessary arrangements
for tbe celebration were coucluded.
The programme for the entertainment in
Turn Verein Hall is a musical affair, with
excellent talent. I: is as follows:

New York, Sept. 3. In view of the
fact that there was no general parade
of labor in this city and that many
down town business house3 were
closed, the day was quiet. Most of the
trade organizations left the city by
early trains and boats for their out
ings, each 'having a program of Its
own. A Labor Day parade was held
in Jersey City under the auspices of
the United Building Trades council of
Hudson county. An incident of this
parade was the action of the Central
Federated union In refusing to march
past the grand stand, in front of the
city hall, where the parade was re
viewed by Mayor Hose and other of
ficials. The Central Federated union
is composed largely of silk weavers
and brewery employes, a large num
ber of whom are professed socialists
and opponents of both political par
ties. When tihey were two blocks
from the grand stand the men of the
Central Federated union fell out of
line and made a dotiour so as to avoid
passing the stand.
At Indianapolis.
Indianapolis, Sept, 3. The Labor
Day parade took place in the morning,
with all the local unions, plenty of

principal event on the program at the

sion made to order. A four-room cot

painted and looking like a permanent

grand stand at a safe distance and
here the audience was allowed to see
!how a natural gas explosion looks.

that moment when the
FHOM rays of the morning
sun gilded the flags of the first
body of marching men until
weary feet turned from the dance toward
rest for a new day's duties, yesterday
was dedicated to Labor. For the
second time the Territory of Hawaii
saw a celebration of Labor Day, and
from busy shop and mansion alike the
people of the city turned out to do
honor to the holiday and tin- men for
whom it was declared.
It was a day full of events. With
parade, oratory, sports and the dance
the hours were filled and until tired
heads ceased to toss on welcome pillows,
there was only time token from the
celebration for refreshment to make
certain the full of enjoyment. It was
a popular holiday,, No business was
done in the city after the early morning
hours, and those who can find no pleasure
In the multitude gave to the day
Us measure of honor in excursion and
luau, In picnic and social gathering.
None was so pressed by duty that time
could not be token for the celebration
of the annual day of testimonial to
trade and union, and those whoso working
hours were shortened by the recur
rence ,of the holiday spent' tho"tlme in-
the many ways devised by expert com
m luces, whose endeavor for weeks has
been the preparation of a program
which would leave nothing to be desired
by those who wished to enjoy an
outing.
That the day was appreciated by the
men and women whose lives are full of
toll, was Bhown by the zest with which
they entered Into the day's events. The
streets were crowded with eager throngs
who had early taken points of vantage
for the purpose of viewing the turnout
of the union men. It was o typical holiday
crowd, for the people were ready
to appreciate the display offered them
and they were unstinted in applause.
When the spcechmaklng began from
the bandstand in the Executive grounds
there were several thousand people
about the stand, and the crowds did not
diminish during the exercises.
Even before these had been completed
there was a movement toward the park
and when the afternoon came it was to
find the vanguard of the throng which"
was to see the events on the sports program
In possession of stand and quarter
stretch. There were five thousand
people in the park during the afternoon
und they seemed to find in the races and
the ball game enough to interest them
until dinner time, and a late dinner it
was too for most of the people of the
city.
Then at night there was a ball at, the
drill shed which was a fitting ending to
i.a day of pleasure. The dancing floor
was crowded until late in the night and
the men and women who had been all
day engaged In various forms of en
joyment capped it all with two steps
and square dances. It was a jolly closing
function for a day of restless pleasures
and the first Labor Day of the new
century will be a memory full of bright
spots for all Honolulu.
PARADE OF THE
UNION WORKMEN
Labor passed in review before Gov.
Dole, Gen. Breckenrldge and the officers,
of the Territory and the army and
navy who had earlier reviewed the military,
soon after the parade was formed.
The feature of the morning was
(he display of the men of the unions
of the city, who marched to show their
fealty to the Idea of union, and their
appreciation of the, holiday which is so
peculiarly their own.
As fsoon as the parade was formed In
Miller street the route was taken up
through the Executive building grounds, i
-i that the reviewing party might see
ll with the men fresh for the mnrch,
and every feature in the best shape.
II wtui Just a. little past nine o'clock
when the notes of a march sounded
nd the grand marshal ordered the ad-
:w m m z
vance. There was a general movement
down the line and with swinging step
the band led the procession Into the
grounds.
There was Just space enough for the
men to get straightened up before they
were in front of the reviewing stand,
which was he Ewa portico of the Exec
utive building. Gov. Dole and Gen.
Breckenrldge were at the front, back of
them being the various officers, Mrs.
Dole, Miss Adams, Mrs. Hoblnuon and
Mrs. White, and as the swinging column
passed them the salutes of the com
manding officers were In evidence and
the men bore their arms and tokens at
a present.
The regular soldiers with MaJ. Davis
commanding followed the band and
marshals, and the two batteries under
command of Captains Slaker and
showed thi'lr form In marching
past the reviewing party, their khaki
uniforms showing In contrast with the
white of the band and the black of the
leaders of the parade. Immediately following
them came the men In whose
honor the day was made a holiday. In
turn the workmen with their unliiue
devices, the floats representative of
their trades, and their attractive costumes,
saluted and their nppearance attracted
the undivided attention of the
members of the reviewing party.
Out of the grounds the procession
passed to meet upon the streets new
thousands of the people who had gathered
to cheer them In their passing.
The greatest crowds had gathered along
Fort street, but as well there were hundreds
at each crossing of the streets and
the people living along the line of the
march did all in their power to show
appreciation of the men In line and the
day they were celebrating.
At no time was there an absence of
enthusiasm and the attention given the
paraders and the floats was worthy of
the endeavor of the committee to make
the turnout an attractive one. The men
me women along the route were un
stinting In their uppluu.se for the pretty

The parade committee had not had
time to bring Into execution their plan
of posting placards at the places where
the different parties forming the parade
were to line up, so the procession did
not Btart at the appointed time. Final-

ly, however, the march began. Five
'mounted policemen riding ahead to
clear the road. With (lowing banners
and martial music the long gaily bedecked
body turned In through the
palace gate and went through tlie
grounds, turning Into King street by
the makal gate. The Grand Marshal,
Matthew Heffern, rode ahead, and right
after him came the band, cheering the
march of the parades with gay music.
The laborers' big banner, bearing the
emblem of a brawny arm holding a
hammer, waving close behind them.
Hereupon came the assistant marshal,
his aides and other officials, followed by
a carriage In which were seated Mr.
Lorrln Andrews and Mr. T. McCants
Stewart, who were amongst the orators
of the day. Two companies of United
Suites marched after thorn, I
and Mr. Francis .Murphy mid Franklin
Austin, also speakers, followed In n car-
rluge.
N'ow came the main of the
parade, namely, the floats and
slon of the various labor unions. The

Plumbers marched ahead, twenty-four
strong; they were dressed In white and
all carried small Japanese paper para-I
sols, making a very pretty display, and
Incidentally shielding themselves from
the hot sun. J
The Electrician Union's iioat the
first one In the procession. It was gully
decorated with red, white and blue
bunting, und equipped with a dynamo,
electiic fans, meters, bells, a telephone
und nil such paraphernalia as belong to
this trade. Every now and then the
bells would ring out during the mnrch.
The electricians followed, twenty-four

hand each man held a brass tube, such
is is used In electric chandeliers and
on the end of the tubes were alternately
red, white and blue electric globes, so

part of the procession. Now came the

the sailors' lloat, an enormous model of
a ship, mounted on a bunting draped
carriage, the sixty-four pallors which
followed, dressed In tasty blue and
white uniforms, and headed by thejed
Stars and Stripes, formed a very pretty
part of the display. Sixteen moulders

lloat, which was conspicuous by a furnace
vomiting yellow name and smoke.

consisted of an enormous boiler, upon
which men were hnmmerlng In rivets,
producing a noWe nlmost aH strong us

lloat belonging to the same union was
gotten up by Catt..il and Nelll. This
float, which was smaller than the first
one, resembled It much In the general
make-up. These floats were followed
by the Boilermakers' and Iron Ship
Builder's Union men.
The and many others.
who Miould have come In this pait of
the parade, were conspicuous by their
absence, but In their place a host of
vehicles, representing different business
houses In town, followed.
First came a sausage wugon, the man
In charge offering the multitude dog-
'meat In different shapes. When his talk
got too much for the soda water people
In the Hawaiian Soda Water Works wagon
behind him, a well directed squirt
from a siphon would shut him up temporarily.
Miller's candy wagon caused
great Joy amongst the younger members
of the crowd, ns candy came flying by
the handful from Its voluminous casks.
Then came, what probably was the most
expensive outfit In the parade, namely
John Nott's two wagons with plumbers'
fittings. A carriage, filled with lawn-
mowers, around which was twisted rub-
ber hose and bunting, came next.
Then came the most imposing, and
to many certainly the most attractive,
number of this part of the program,
namely the Hawaiian Beer Co.'s lloat
and wagons. The float consisted of a
big red-painted canvas house, upon the
front of which "Home Industry" was
written In large letters.
Upon the first of the beer wagons
stood a benevolent personage, clad In
fantastic raiment and a still more fan
tastlc wig. He was easily the favorite
of the parude, as he, with liberal hand,
distributed foaming schooners whenever
a stop was made. A parcel delivery
wagon, draped in bunting followed, and
Lewers Cooke's display ended the
parude. This display, which was more
noticeable because of Its extent, con-
,slsted of fifteen or sixteen wagons loud-
with all kinds of material, which the
firm carries, split posts, glass, wallpaper,
paint, lumber of all kinds, etc.,
etc. The firm evidently Intended to live
up to the motto, which they had on
their first carriage, "What we do not
carry, Is not worth handling."
Notwithstanding its length, the procession
must he said to have proceeded

Joyed with fun, noise ami laugh

the Capitol building, where It dispersed.

The Winter's Outlook
Some of the things we should worry
about are the constant increase in the
cost of living, and the constant de
crease in the number of people re
quired to produce all the necessities
and luxuries that can be consumed by
the people of this country. Our faci
lities for production are constantly be
coming more efficient, so that a short
er time is required and fewer people
are employed in the performance of
these functions than ever before in
the history of the world. These, and
a number of other things must be taken
into serious consideration in the final
settlement of any wage disputes or
similar controversies in existence at
the present time.
The present and immediate future
cost of living is another serious con
sideration. The cost of living has seen
a considerable step-up during the past
year, and according to all indications
the coming winter is likely to see an
additional step-up of probably 15 per
cent in the prices of the staple food
commodities that workers use most.
Where will the worker find this extra
purchasing power? Certainly not in
the pay envelopes the large employ
ers intend to force upon him. Through
the F.E.R.A. the employers have found
out how little the workers and their
families can exist upon, and hereafter,
that is the mark at which they are
shooting in re-arranging! their wage
scales. In a great many cases this
short-sighted policy amounts to actual
blindness. They fail to realize they
are humping their own destination.
There are many ways in which this
situation may be remedied, but its en
tire elimination is the thing for which
we are most desirous. As a prelude
to this ever to be hoped for consuma
tion, we believe that an adequate Old
Age Pension Law coupled with an In
heritance and Income Tax Laws, where
by Estates for inheritance purposes
and Incomes from whatever source de
rived be taxed at 100 per cent above
certain predetermined amounts,
these amounts were placed low en
ough, there wouldn't be much incen
tive to build up huge fortunes, there
by keeping the workers and their fam
ilies continually on the verge of starva
tion. These fat boys, like Con Kelly
and a lot more of them would very
likely relinquish a lot of the product
they have been appropriating to them
selves and spread it around in wages
rather than turn it over to the govern
ment in taxes.
Of course, Con knows as well as we
do, and probably better, that he isn't
worth the huge salary he pays him
self. He pays himself that salary be
cause he happens to be in a position
that permits him to dictate the amount
he will collect. Perhaps he realizes he
would be just as happy and content
with one per cent of the huge salary
he pulls down. But, be that as it may,
these people will not do anything to
remedy this situation on the contrary
they are doing everything in their pow
er to intensify it. Consequently, it is
up to the intelligent rank and file of
the working class to do .something
about it.
It has been said that in a country
where the people have universal suf
frage, the government of that country
and the conditions under which the
people live, must be good enough for
a majority of those people. If they
weren't, the people would change them.
Welt, that contention seems perfectly
logical; but of course, it isn't as easy
as that. Human nature being what
it is, the working class will require a
lot of experience and education before
it measures up to that standard. But
the outlook for the future looks bright
and we believe that if a real working
class political and economic movement
was launched, with a comprehensive
program of progressive principles, that
its success would be immediate.
Meantime, we must keep our col
lective ear to the ground, repeal, to
the best of our abilities every invasion
of our rights. Sec that when this
strike is settled, it is settled right and
that every move we make is calculat
ed to strengthen our position in the
future.

Railway Workers
and the New Deal
The railroads, 137 strong, have asked
an injunction to prevent the Railroad
Retirement Board from collecting as
sessments from the carriers and their
employers under the provisions of the
Railroad Pension Act which was
passed by the last Congress. The car
riers, as was expected, invoke the "due
process" clause as well as the inter
state commerce clause of the Consti
tution. The Railroad Pension bill,
which has just gone into effect, is the
Administration's only tangible accom
plishment to date in the matter of eco
nomic-security legislation. Almost all
the carriers intend to continue their
"charity" pension plans until forced to
discontinue them by judicial edict.
Some of them, like the Pennsylvania,
will immediately begin making the
payroll deductions required by the law,
but will segregate the funds pending
the outcome of the suit. Holding fast
to the capitalistic ethic, the railroad
executives believe that retirement pen
sions should be a reward bestowed out
of the overflowing good-will of the
employer. They cannot as yet accept
the idea that the employer owes it as
a legal duty to his workers to provide
for their old age. More concretely,
the charges imposed by the bill on the
railroads represent a substantial step
ping-up over the contributions which
the railroads have seen fit to make un

Alabama Miners Win
An important victory has been won
by the iron-ore miners of Alabama,
who are organized under the Interna
tional Union of Miine, Mill and Smelt
er Workers. Previous to the strike,
the condition of these miners was com
parable to that of the slaves before the
Civil War. Negro miners were in some
cases paid less than $1.00 a day and
even that was not in currency but in
scrip that could be spent only at the
company stores.
Now their wages are $4.56 for an 8
hour day, which is 31c higher than the
basic wage of Butte miners. Besides
the raise in pay, they won other im
portant concessions. The negro and
white miners stood solidly together
during a long and bitter strike in which
all the forces of a vicious corporation
and a reactionary state government
were used against them. It is estimat
ed by strike leaders that 35 men were
killed during the struggle. A high
price to pay for a living wage and the
human rights supposedly guaranteed
under the Constitution.
The Birmingham mines are mostly
controlled by the Tennessee Coal and
Iron Co. which is a Morgan enterprise
captured during the panic of 1907. This
Company has played the same role of
feudal overlord in Alabama as the Ana
conda Co. has played in Montana. The
low standard of living of the South
ern industrial worker has long been a
sore spot in the labor movement. It
is surely encouraging to see them or
ganizing into industrial unions and car
rying thru a successful struggle for
better conditions of life.

	<text>HISTORY OF LABOR DAY
Facts in the Case Compiled by
Hugh Cavanaugh.
NEW YORK CITY FIRST
A Monster Parade in 186--Oregon the
First State to Make September 6
a Legal Holiday-The Gos
pal of Humanity.
The history of legislation by the dif
ferent states of the union in behalf of
a Labor day will be found of particular
interest in Montana at this time. Hugh
Cavanaugh in his publication, the
Butte Labor Day Souvenir," has made
the following compilation on the sub
ject:
"Labor day may be said to have been
first celebrated in New York city, the
occasion being In honor of the sixth an
nual convention of the Knights of La
bor, which convened in that city Sept.
5, 1882. The celebration conolated of a
monster parade of the labor organiza
tions, followed by a picnic at which ad
dresses were delivered by several of the
delegates in attendance.
"When the general assembly con
vened on the above date, a communica
tion was read from the secretary of the
New York Central Labor union inviting
the members of the body to review the
great parade from the grand stand at
Union square. While the parade was
passing, one of the delegates turned to
his associates and said: 'This is Labor
day in earnest.'
"Whether this was the first time the
term had been used is not known, but
the event was afterwards referred to as
'the Labor day parade.'
"Two years later, when the labor or
ganizations had the question of parad
ing up for discussion, George K. Lloyd,
a Knight of Labor, offered a resolution
declaring the first Monday in Septem
ber to be Labor day. The resolution
was adopted and steps were at once
taken to have the legislature enact a
law to make the day a legal holiday to
be known as Labor day. Although New
York was the first state to introduce
the measure before the legislature, Ore
gon was the first to pass the bill into
law. Prior to the act of congress four
years ago making the day a national
holiday, nearly 30 of the states had
adopted Labor day legislation, a list of
which we append and, as near as possi
ble, the names of those who introduced
the bills and the dates on which the
measures became laws.
"It was the intention of these who in
troduced the first Labor day resolution
to make the day stand apart from all
other holidays in the nature of its ob
servance; the princlpal feature of the
exercises of the day was to consist of
lectures and discourses upon topics re
lating to the welfare of the industrial
masses. Every question of political, so
cial and economic importance should be
discussed at the meetings on Labor day.
Those who address such meetings are
burdened with a weighty responsibility.
It is their duty to teach a doctrine of
Independence of thought and action to
the industrious, the right of man to all
that his labor creates, and the duty of
the Industrious as a self-reliant citizen
should all occupy the thought of the
speaker and be the theme of his dis
course.
"That which will best serve the living
men and women of to-day and the fu
ture should receive the careful att.n
tion of all who take part in honoring
that greatest of all factors in minister
ing to the good of the world, labor. If
Labor day is observed as it ought to be,
the gospel of humanity will be under
stood by all men and women, there will
be no slaves to employer, party, boss or
creed.
"The following is the list, in alpha
betical order of the states that adopted
Labor day legislation prior' to the na
tional law:
"Alabama-Hon. Oscar R. Hundley,
member of the senate from Huntsville.
introduced the bill making the first
Monday In September a holiday. to be
known as Labor day. The same was
enacted into law and received the sig
nature of Governor Thomas G. Jones on
Dec. 12, 1892.
"California-Senator N. C. Maher of
San Francisco introduced the measure
during the last session. It passed both
houses and received the approval of
Governor H. H. Markham on March. 21,
1t93. Labor day in California is held on
the first Monday of October.
'Colorado-On Jan. 20, 1887, Hon. Jo
seph F. Hooper of Leadville introduced
a bill in the legislature, and on March
15 of that year Governor Alva Adams
affixed his signature to the act after its
passage through both houses of the Col
oradd legislature.
"Connecticut-Hon. A. F. Hunte, on
Jan. 22, 1889, introduced the bill in the
Connecticut legislature: it became a
law and was approved by the governor
on March 20, 1899.
"Delaware-Senator John Pyle of
Wilmington irtroduced the Labor day
law in the legislature of Delaware. It
passed both houses and was approved
on Feb. 14, 1893. In Delaware the gov
ernor is not required to sign or ap
prove of laws passed by the legislature,
and the Labor day law bears the signa
ture of Charles B. Houston, speaker of
the senate, and Harvey Whiteman,
speaker of the house of representatives
of Delaware.
"Georgia-The legislature of 1891
passed into law the bill introduced by
Hon. E. W. Martin, and on Oct. 16 of
that year Governor W. J. Northen
signed the bill.
"Illinois-The Thirty-seventh general
assembly of Illinois passed the law
making the first Monday in September
a legal holiday. The bill was introduced
in the senate by Hon. Albert W. Wells
and approved by Governor Joseph W.
Fifer on June 17, 1891.
"Indiana-l- y an art of the legisla
ture. approved March 9, 1891. the first
Monday in September was made a legal
holiday, to be known as Labor day.
"Iowa--On Feb. 28, 1890, Hon. W. W.
Dodge introduced the original bill mak
ing Labor day a legal holiday to the
lowa senate. A substitute was offered,
and on March 19 all members of the
senate voted for the measure. It went
to the lower house and was adopted
there on March 26, all present voting
for it, and on April 5, 1890, was signed
by Governor Boles.
"Kansas-The custom of recognizing
the first Monday in September as Labor
day was established in Kansas in 1890,
and the governor of the state made it
legal by proclamation. At the session
of 1891 Governor Lyman I'. Humphrey,
in his biennial message, recommended
that the legislature enact the measure
Into law. Senator Elliston introduced
the bill in the senate. It became a law
and was signed by the governor on
March 4., 1891.
"Louisiana-Act 93 of 1892 makes Nov.
25 a legal holiday, to he known as La
bor day, in New Orleans and all cities
with a population of 100,000 inhabitan:s
in the state. Governor M. J. Foster ap
proved of the hill July 7, 1892.
"Maine-Maine enacted a law at the
session of the legislature held in 1891.
and declared the first Monday ln Sep

was reviewed in Union Square by
prominent labor leaders and ended with
a celebration and speeches in Elm
Park.

passed ordinances making the first
Monday in September a municipal

53 Years Since First National Labor Day
Labor's long fight against oppression
is highlighted by the issues it has
raised on Labor Day since the national
holiday was established in 1894.
1894-1905
The crucial issue of the period was
the rapid development of the trusts.
Golden tongued William Jennings
Bryan was one of the most popular
speakers at Labor Day demonstra
tions, where unionists raised the cry
for a boycott. On Labor Day 1901
workers demonstrated in support of a
strike against J. P. Morgan's new' steel
trust, U. H. Steel, and In 1903 parade
placards declared: "The trusts fight
us—let's fight the trusts by not using
their goods."
1905-1915
As the trusts grew, so grew the vio
lence against labor. The use of in
junctions drew Labor Day wrath. AFL
Pres. Samuel Gompers told a 1907
Labor Day demonstration: "The in
junctions as issued against workmen
are never issued against any other
citizens. It is an effort to fasten an
offense against them when they are
innocent of wrongdoing." A 1910 pa
rader carried the slogan; "Plutocracy
Governor's
(I 'on I In lied from Paire One)
the event of dissolution of the corpor-1
ation shall not be deemed forbidden
to such non-profit corporations". (Em
phasis ours)
Obviously, the three or more actual
incorporators of one of these "social
clubs" will be able to find sufficient
use for all the funds accruing from
the operation of the club for "legiti
mate operating and administrative ex
penses". And the other simple card
holding members will have to get all
their benefits from supplying the cash
for these "operating and administra
tive expenses".
Special Session Might Be
Embarrassing
It is not expected that the Governor
will call any special session to stop
the organization of these clubs. It is
the general opinion of competent at
torneys that the racket can be stopped
by simple court action. Moreover,
the embarassing question he has to
answer of—why he saw fit to veto
HB 403 which would not have permit
ted the present flood of organization
of "social club" rackets even though
HB 353 had been passed or even SR 75,
would be sure to be brought up in a
special session.
And "Saintly Sam" would have a
hard time justifying himself. His ter
rible anger about conditions now indi
cates considerable histrionic ability,
and perhaps may be just an opening
gun in a campaign to endear himself
again with the more straight-laced
of the church people of the state, who
are not familiar with all phases of
why these conditions exist.
They can be laid squarely at the door
of Saintly Sam. Had he not vetoed
HB 403 they would not be here.
steals our soap, then calls us the great
unwashed."
As the first world war hung over
the land, labor opposed U. S. participa-;
tion. On Labor Day 1915 AFL Sec.
1915-1920
Frank Morrison declared: "Labor
sees the wolf of militarism concealed
behind the Little Red Riding Hood
pretense of those men responsible for
Ludlow." His reference: the mass
acre of 33 w'omen and children in the
historic strike against John D. Rocke
feller's Colorado Fuel Iron Co. Labor
Day 1917 saw' most of labor swing to
support the war which the U. S. had
entered.
1920-1925
End of the war brought quick re
newal of the onslaught against labor.
Labor Day 1922 saw the union move
ment, threatening a general strike,
rallied in opposition to Atty. Gen.
Harry Daugherty's sweeping injunc

1925-1930
The so-called Golden '20s brought
a lull in union militancy, a slump in
union membership as many thought
the millenium had come to stay.
1930-1935
But the end came with a crash,
bringing with it bewilderment, bitter
criticisim of Herbert Hoover's do
nothingism, growing demands for un
employment relief, jobs, security. The
advent of the New Deal brought the
NRA and section 7 (a) and labor's
resentment channeled itself into sud
den union growth. Employers' oppos
ition drew from AFL Pres. William
Green on Labor Day 1933 a demand
for court action against violators of
NRA collective bargaining agree
ments.

Their traditions and their pride make
their present lot difficult to endure
because it precludes normal prewar
social life. Many of them talk about
leaving England, and those who get
the chance to migrate seize it eagerly,
he continued.
Military Methods Won't Do It
The struggle to contain Communist
influence in Europe promises to be
long-drawn, subtle and not susceptible
to the use of military methods, he con
cluded. From the British, who coped
with the job of keeping tabs on the
Czarist Empire during the 19th cen
tury, Harsch derived the impression
that the conflict will have to be waged
by the same slow, persistent diplomat
ic, economic and political means.—PM,

are na
Great masses of the common people
—the people who made this country and still keep it
afloat as a going concern—are growing tired of being
pushed around, cut off, chiseled on, and high priced
into pauperism, and they want a development in which
they can share, have a say, and enjoy security.
The Big Boys have the jack, control most of the
avenues of publicity, and are able to employ a whole
legion of henchmen and fixers. Moreover they finance
a lot of politicians into power and are able to apply
a heavy pressure on those they do not own. All this
permits them to keep the real issue either concealed or
so muddled that the man in the street is often a long
time getting it straightened out in his own mind. Bas
ically this does not change the actual issue, it only
muddles things and delays final settlement.
'I o force settlement in their own interest and by
overwhelming numbers the common folks have the

The only question is whether they will use this
power to the best purpose, which is their own self-in

It is a safe bet that ninety-nine percent of in
dividuals who have an assured income of $10,000 per
year or more are, and will continue to be, against an
MVA. Ninety-nine percent of those with incomes less
than $10,000 per year should be for an MVA. The
great majority of them undoubtedly will be when they
understand that self-interest is quite as important to
them as it is to he Big Fat Boys who will vote the
other way.

make it work.—JEROME G. LOCKE, Member of Reg

1935-1940
The labor upsurge sharpened the
split on craft vs. industrial unionism,
brought the sudden bursting birth of
the CIO, headed by John L. Lewis,

On Labor Day 1937, as Green hailed
the U. S. supreme court's decision up
holding the Wagner act establishing
labor's right to bargain collectively,
Lewis reported the CIO's organizing
and sitdown strikes had won it a mil
lion new members in its first year.
1940-1945
Labor Days at the turn of the de
cade found labor divided on its atti
tude toward World War II. Some
unions favored all aid to those fight
ing the Axis short of U. S. involve
ment. Others held a hands-off posi
tion. But Labor Day 1942, nine
months after U. S. entry, found labor
united in support of the fight. Labor
Day 1945 was a day of victory and
mourning. The w r ar was w'on. Frank

Keynote of the postwar period was
struck by William Green, Labor Day

of fascism in America have determined
to smash trade unions." Said
CIO Pres. Philip Murray; "Greed and
